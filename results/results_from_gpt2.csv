A Latent-Variable Bayesian Nonparametric Regression Model,"  We introduce a random partition model for Bayesian nonparametric regression.
The model is based on infinitely-many disjoint regions of the range of a latent
covariate-dependent Gaussian process. Given a realization of the process, the
cluster of dependent variable responses that share a common region are assumed
to arise from the same distribution. Also, the latent Gaussian process prior
allows for the random partitions (i.e., clusters of the observations) to
exhibit dependencies among one another. The model is illustrated through the
analysis of a real data set arising from education, and through the analysis of
simulated data that were generated from complex data-generating models.
","A Latent-Variable Bayesian Nonparametric Regression Model (Latent Variable Bay) is an integral function implemented in a Bayley model using the concept of a latent variable:

The model is a nonparameterized Bayes variable with a linear parameter distribution, which is one of many measures of an estimate.

"Emergence of Topological Fermi Liquid from a Strongly Correlated Bosonic
  System in Optical Superlattices","  Recent experiments on quantum degenerate gases give an opportunity for
simulating strongly-correlated electronic systems in optical lattices. It may
shed light on some long-standing puzzles in condensed-matter physics, like the
nature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates that had baffled
people over two decades. It is believed that the two-dimensional fermionic
Hubbard model, or t-J model, contains the key to this problem; but the
difficulty of unveiling the mystery of a strongly-interacting fermionic system
is also generally acknowledged. Here, as a substitute, we systematically
analyze the property of bosonic t-J model simulated in optical superlattices
near unit-filling. In particular, we show the emergence of a strange
topological Fermi liquid with Fermi surfaces from a purely bosonic system. We
also discuss the possibility of observing these phenomena in ultracold atom
experiments. The result may provide some crucial insights into the origin of
high-T_{c} superconductivity.
","Emergence of Topological Fermi Liquid from a Strongly Correlated Bosonic
  System in Optical Superlattices

As shown in a paper from 1997, topological equilibrium can be explained by the inclusion of a system of highly correlated systems. However, this explanation was too weak for the superlaukeptic in 1999/2000 with only one paper to explain how topology explains topos, for example. We know that topoclines, by virtue of their large areas, are a source of topo in superclimate solutions. Therefore, we have to say something about toposes, because our solution should be compatible with what we call topole symmetry.

"Modified FRW cosmologies arising from states of the hybrid quantum Gowdy
  model","  We construct approximate solutions of the hybrid quantum Gowdy cosmology with
three-torus topology, linear polarization, and local rotational symmetry, in
the presence of a massless scalar field. More specifically, we determine some
families of states for which the complicated inhomogeneous and anisotropic
Hamiltonian constraint operator of the Gowdy model is approximated by a much
simpler one. Our quantum states follow the dynamics governed by this simpler
constraint, while being at the same time also approximate solutions of the full
Gowdy model. This is so thanks to the quantum correlations that the considered
states present between the isotropic and anisotropic sectors of the model.
Remarkably, this simpler constraint can be regarded as that of a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe filled with different kinds of perfect
fluids and geometrically corrected by homogeneous and isotropic curvature-like
terms. Therefore, our quantum states, which are intrinsically inhomogeneous,
admit approximate homogeneous and isotropic effective descriptions similar to
those considered in modified theories of gravity.

  model and their derivation are shown in Fig. 6. The models are based on the superconducting Fermi-Fern particle bosom quantum state, wherein the Figgs boson is a large group of particles of similar size, with small mass with fast quantum gravity. It is said that this new state also represents a quantum of Fern: a state in which the particles interact with a small particle known as an electron and which also has the same mass and velocity, thus providing a potential energy source to the electron.

Huffman Coding as a Non-linear Dynamical System,"  In this paper, source coding or data compression is viewed as a measurement
problem. Given a measurement device with fewer states than the observable of a
stochastic source, how can one capture the essential information? We propose
modeling stochastic sources as piecewise linear discrete chaotic dynamical
systems known as Generalized Lur\""{o}th Series (GLS) which dates back to Georg
Cantor's work in 1869. The Lyapunov exponent of GLS is equal to the Shannon's
entropy of the source (up to a constant of proportionality). By successively
approximating the source with GLS having fewer states (with the closest
Lyapunov exponent), we derive a binary coding algorithm which exhibits minimum
redundancy (the least average codeword length with integer codeword lengths).
This turns out to be a re-discovery of Huffman coding, the popular lossless
compression algorithm used in the JPEG international standard for still image
compression.

Spin Hall effect in iron-based superconductors: A Dirac-point effect,"  We have theoretically explored the intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) in the
iron-based superconductor family with a variety of materials. The study is
motivated by an observation that, in addition to an appreciable spin-orbit
coupling in the Fe 3d states, a character of the band structure in which Dirac
cones appear below the Fermi energy may play a crucial role in producing a
large SHE. Our investigation does indeed predict a substantially large spin
Hall conductivity in the heavily hole-doped regime such as KFe$_2$As$_2$. The
magnitude of the SHE has turned out to be comparable with that for Pt despite a
relatively small spin-orbit coupling, which we identify to come from a huge
contribution from the gap opening induced by the spin-orbit coupling at the
Dirac point, which can become close to the Fermi energy for the heavy hole
doping.

Quantum quench influenced by an excited-state phase transition,"  We analyze excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) in three
schematic (integrable and nonintegrable) models describing a single-mode

of the ESQPT in these models affects the quantum relaxation processes following
an abrupt quench in the control parameter. Clear cut evidence of the ESQPT

fringe corrections and wavelength offsets, with different algorithms for point

The Role of Pragmatics in Legal Norm Representation,"  Despite the 'apparent clarity' of a given legal provision, its application
may result in an outcome that does not exactly conform to the semantic level of
a statute. The vagueness within a legal text is induced intentionally to
accommodate all possible scenarios under which such norms should be applied,
thus making the role of pragmatics an important aspect also in the
representation of a legal norm and reasoning on top of it. The notion of
pragmatics considered in this paper does not focus on the aspects associated
with judicial decision making. The paper aims to shed light on the aspects of
pragmatics in legal linguistics, mainly focusing on the domain of patent law,
only from a knowledge representation perspective. The philosophical discussions
presented in this paper are grounded based on the legal theories from Grice and
Marmor.

of the field equations and dynamical system tools to study the evolution. We
find an inflationary source at early times, and an inflationary sink at late
times, for a wide region in the parameter space. The results by A. A. Coley, G.
Leon, P. Sandin and J. Latta (JCAP 12, 010, 2015), are then re-obtained as
particular cases. Additionally, we select other values for the non-GR
parameters which are consistent with current constraints, getting a very rich
phenomenology. In particular, we find solutions with infinite shear, zero
curvature, and infinite matter energy density in comparison with the Hubble
scalar. We also have stiff-like future attractors, anisotropic late-time
attractors, or both, in some special cases. Such results are developed

"Equivalent Theories Redefine Hamiltonian Observables to Exhibit Change
  in General Relativity","  Change and local spatial variation are missing in canonical General
Relativity's observables as usually defined, part of the problem of time.
Definitions can be tested using equivalent formulations, non-gauge and gauge,
because they must have equivalent observables and everything is observable in
the non-gauge formulation. Taking an observable from the non-gauge formulation
and finding the equivalent in the gauge formulation, one requires that the
equivalent be an observable, constraining definitions. For massive photons, the
de Broglie-Proca non-gauge formulation observable A_{\mu} is equivalent to the
Stueckelberg-Utiyama gauge formulation quantity A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu} \phi.
Thus observables must have 0 Poisson bracket not with each first-class
constraint, but with the Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator
G, a tuned sum of first-class constraints, in accord with the
Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables.
  The definition for external gauge symmetries can be tested using massive
gravity, where one can install gauge freedom by parametrization with clock
fields X^A. The non-gauge observable g^{\mu\nu} has the gauge equivalent
X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu} X^B,_{\nu}. The Poisson bracket of X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu}
X^B,_{\nu} with G turns out to be not 0 but a Lie derivative. This non-zero
Poisson bracket refines and systematizes Kuchar's proposal to relax the 0
Poisson bracket condition with the Hamiltonian constraint. Thus observables
need covariance, not invariance, in relation to external gauge symmetries.
  The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian for massive gravity are those of General
Relativity + Lambda + 4 scalars, so the same definition of observables applies
to General Relativity. Local fields such as g_{\mu\nu} are observables. Thus
observables change. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent theories
also recovers Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence.
","Equivalent Theories Redefine Hamiltonian Observables to Exhibit Change
  in General Relativity Theorem that Relativists and Relates can be shown to have different effects on the distribution of discrete features has been shown by experimental observations. It is difficult to determine (as one would expected with large group sizes, with all of the variables in a single model) if the effects of these variables are uniformly distributed. Thus, different methods of experimentation can produce information regarding the actual distribution, but some experiments have shown that their distribution may differ. As such, the ""recovery"" of RQs. A simple formula called the C-type constant is used to predict how the changes in the R Q can lead to a change in T Q R. The C type constant, however, will not tell the difference between the two, since one cannot predict the type Q independently of any of its derivatives. The simplest and most common method of experimenting to show the truth of this constant lies in demonstrating that all variations of TQ are the result of some external influence such as (1) an increase of energy; (2) a decrease in energy by a process of adaptation, for instance by the processof adaptation in which a given time series of physical and chemical objects",0.2527198960963595,0.20714285214387768,0.17077739477063614

redshift z=0.28-1.65 (median redshift z=0.84). Our sample are representative of
star-forming, main-sequence galaxies, with star-formation rates of
SFR=0.1-30Mo/yr and stellar masses M=10^8-10^11Mo. For 49+/-4% of our sample,
the dynamics suggest rotational support, 24+/-3% are unresolved systems and
5+/-2% appear to be early-stage major mergers with components on 8-30kpc
scales. The remaining 22+/-5% appear to be dynamically complex, irregular (or
face-on systems). For galaxies whose dynamics suggest rotational support, we
derive inclination corrected rotational velocities and show these systems lie
on a similar scaling between stellar mass and specific angular momentum as
local spirals with j*=J/M*\propto M^(2/3) but with a redshift evolution that
scales as j*\propto M^{2/3}(1+z)^(-1). We identify a correlation between
specific angular momentum and disk stability such that galaxies with the
highest specific angular momentum, log(j*/M^(2/3))>2.5, are the most stable,
with Toomre Q=1.10+/-0.18, compared to Q=0.53+/-0.22 for galaxies with
log(j*/M^(2/3))<2.5. At a fixed mass, the HST morphologies of galaxies with the
highest specific angular momentum resemble spiral galaxies, whilst those with
low specific angular momentum are morphologically complex and dominated by
several bright star-forming regions. This suggests that angular momentum plays
a major role in defining the stability of gas disks: at z~1, massive galaxies
that have disks with low specific angular momentum, appear to be globally
unstable, clumpy and turbulent systems. In contrast, galaxies with high
specific angular have evolved in to stable disks with spiral structures.

"A Novel Approach for Ellipsoidal Outer-Approximation of the Intersection
  Region of Ellipses in the Plane","  In this paper, a novel technique for tight outer-approximation of the
intersection region of a finite number of ellipses in 2-dimensional (2D) space
is proposed. First, the vertices of a tight polygon that contains the convex
intersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so, the
intersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the
intersection region are determined, and a set of points is generated on the
elliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring intersection points. By finding
the tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points, a set of
half-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the
polygon more efficiently, the points are given an order and the intersection of
the half-planes corresponding to every two neighbouring points is calculated.
If the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points together with the
initially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon
is non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate
additional discrete points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the
issue, and restart the algorithm to obtain a bounded and convex polygon.
Finally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the polygon is
obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical
experiments, it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter
outer-approximation of the intersection of multiple ellipses, compared to
conventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational cost.

Elliptical rotation of an ellipse of equal size that follows the mean path length is called intersection. In Earth orbit, elliptic lines of ellipsis can be calculated as the distance from the point A to a point B that lies under the inner portion of one elliferous line afterwards until it reaches the sun's central point L. A. The length of its central line increases and decreases as it passes around the sphere, with R_a = [x^2[3] + v_b + R^(r_A/2) ].

On the pure state outcomes of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering,"  In the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen experiment, when Alice makes a measurement
on her part of a bipartite system, Bob's part is collapsed to, or steered to, a
specific ensemble. Moreover, by reading her measurement outcome, Alice can
specify which state in the ensemble Bob's system is steered to and with which
probability. The possible states that Alice can steer Bob's system to are
called steered states. In this work, we study the subset of steered states
which are pure after normalisation. We illustrate that these pure steered
states, if they exist, often carry interesting information about the shared
bipartite state. This information content becomes particularly clear when we
study the purification of the shared state. Some applications are discussed.
These include a generalisation of the fundamental lemma in the so-called
`all-versus-nothing proof of steerability' for systems of arbitrary dimension.
","On the pure state outcomes of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, which are similar to what it would have done if only the wheels were on the other side, two of the steering's most important aspects are still fundamentally different.

Unethical Research: How to Create a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence,"  Cybersecurity research involves publishing papers about malicious exploits as
much as publishing information on how to design tools to protect
cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between ethical hackers
and security experts, which results in a well-balanced cyber-ecosystem. In the
blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering, hundreds of papers have been
published on different proposals geared at the creation of a safe machine, yet
nothing, to our knowledge, has been published on how to design a malevolent
machine. Availability of such information would be of great value particularly
to computer scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI
safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or the
deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect human
activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration of the human
species. This paper provides some general guidelines for the creation of a
Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI).

Hawking Radiation and Entropic Gravity,"  I present a new derivation of Hawking radiation by applying the Crooks
fluctuation theorem to the laws of black hole thermodynamics. Then, by analogy
with the quantum fluctuation theorem, this allows one to identify microstates
contributing to the black hole entropy. These microstates have an evolution
operator on the horizon between initial and final states that is related to the
entropic gravity proposal. Their full calculation perhaps requires a deeper

"Image-Image Domain Adaptation with Preserved Self-Similarity and
  Domain-Dissimilarity for Person Re-identification","  Person re-identification (re-ID) models trained on one domain often fail to
generalize well to another. In our attempt, we present a ""learning via
translation"" framework. In the baseline, we translate the labeled images from
source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models
with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being an essential part
of this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the
information loss of source-domain labels during translation.
  Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues
contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given
the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image
should be dissimilar to any of the target IDs. To this end, we propose to
preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image
before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated
source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the
similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of
an Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we
show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and
yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets.

"Joint analysis of functional genomic data and genome-wide association
  studies of 18 human traits","  Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for
interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We
describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across
the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted
for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple
types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits,
including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels,
height, BMI, and Crohn's disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of
450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers,
and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We
show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein
sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL
cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs
associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I
hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for
example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS
using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with
high-confidence associations by around 5%.

Waves as the source of apparent twisting motions in sunspot penumbrae,"  The motion of dark striations across bright filaments in a sunspot penumbra
has become an important new diagnostic of convective gas flows in penumbral
filaments. The nature of these striations has, however, remained unclear. Here
we present an analysis of small scale motions in penumbral filaments in both
simulations and observations. The simulations, when viewed from above, show
fine structure with dark lanes running outwards from the dark core of the
penumbral filaments. The dark lanes either occur preferentially on one side or
alternate between both sides of the filament. We identify this fine structure
with transverse (kink) oscillations of the filament, corresponding to a
sideways swaying of the filament. These oscillations have periods in the range
of 5-7 min and propagate outward and downward along the filament. Similar
features are found in observed G-band intensity time series of penumbral
filaments in a sunspot located near disk center obtained by the Broadband
Filter Imager (BFI) on board {\it Hinode}. We also find that some filaments
show dark striations moving to both sides of the filaments. Based on the
agreement between simulations and observations we conclude that the motions of
these striations are caused by transverse oscillations of the underlying bright
filaments.

contributions: it addresses the practical matters that are major concerns for
organisations to achieve a higher maturity level with their SOA, and it reveals
the importance of the key SOA aspects in building strong governance and
consequently reaching a higher maturity level. The expected result should
deliver a theoretical contribution to SOA maturity in relation to SOA
governance; it could provide organisations with new awareness in assessing
their level of maturity and provide recommendations.

Anderson Localization at Band Edges for Random Magnetic Fields,"  We consider a magnetic Schr\""odinger operator in two dimensions. The magnetic
field is given as the sum of a large and constant magnetic field and a random

well as a magnetic field which are both periodic. We show that the spectrum of
this operator is contained in broadened bands around the Landau levels and that
the edges of these bands consist of pure point spectrum with exponentially

"GMC Collisions as Triggers of Star Formation. III. Density and
  Magnetically Regulated Star Formation","  We study giant molecular cloud (GMC) collisions and their ability to trigger
star cluster formation. We further develop our three dimensional magnetized,
turbulent, colliding GMC simulations by implementing star formation sub-grid
models. Two such models are explored: (1) ""Density-Regulated,"" i.e., fixed
efficiency per free-fall time above a set density threshold; (2)
""Magnetically-Regulated,"" i.e., fixed efficiency per free-fall time in regions
that are magnetically supercritical. Variations of parameters associated with
these models are also explored. In the non-colliding simulations, the overall
level of star formation is sensitive to model parameter choices that relate to
effective density thresholds. In the GMC collision simulations, the final star
formation rates and efficiencies are relatively independent of these
parameters. Between non-colliding and colliding cases, we compare the
morphologies of the resulting star clusters, properties of star-forming gas,
time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), spatial clustering of the
stars, and resulting kinematics of the stars in comparison to the natal gas. We
find that typical collisions, by creating larger amounts of dense gas, trigger
earlier and enhanced star formation, resulting in 10 times higher SFRs and
efficiencies. The star clusters formed from GMC collisions show greater spatial
sub-structure and more disturbed kinematics.

"Ab initio prediction of magnetically dead layers in freestanding
  $\gamma$-Ce(111)","  It is well known that the surface of nonmagnetic $\alpha$-Ce is magnetically
ordered, i.e., $\gamma$-like. One then might conjecture, in agreement with
previous theoretical predictions, that the $\gamma$-Ce may also exhibit at its
surfaces even more strongly enhanced $\gamma$-like magnetic ordering.
Nonetheless, our result shows that the (111)-surfaces of magnetic $\gamma$-Ce
are neither spin nor orbitally polarized, i.e., $\alpha$-like. Therefore, we
predict, in contrast to the nonmagnetic $\alpha$-phase which tends to produce
magnetically ordered $\gamma$-like thin layers at its free surfaces, the
magnetic $\gamma$-phase has a tendency to form $\alpha$-like dead layers. This
study, which explains the suppressed (promoted) surface magnetic moments of
$\gamma$-Ce ($\alpha$-Ce), shows that how nanoscale can reverse physical
properties by going from bulk to the surface in isostructural $\alpha$- and
$\gamma$-phases of cerium. We predict using our freestanding surface results
that a typical unreactive and non-diffusive substrate can dramatically
influence the magnetic surface of cerium thin films in contrast to most of the
uncorrelated thin films and strongly correlated transition metals. Our result
implies that magnetic surface moments of $\alpha$-Ce(111) can be suddenly
disappeared by increasing lattice mismatch at the interface of a typical

"Current-induced spin polarization for a general two-dimensional electron
  system","  In this paper, current-induced spin polarization for two-dimensional electron
gas with a general spin-orbit interaction is investigated. For isotropic energy
spectrum, the in-plane current-induced spin polarization is found to be
dependent on the electron density for non-linear spin-orbit interaction and
increases with the increment of sheet density, in contrast to the case for $\bm
k$-linear spin-orbit coupling model. The numerical evaluation is performed for
InAs/InSb heterojunction with spin-orbit coupling of both linear and cubic
spin-orbit coupling types. For $\delta$-type short-range electron-impurity
scattering, it is found that the current-induced spin polarization increases
with increasing the density when cubic spin-orbit couplings are considered.
However, for remote disorders, a rapid enhancement of current-induced spin
polarization is always observed at high electron density, even in the case
without cubic spin-orbit coupling. This result demonstrates the
collision-related feature of current-induced spin polarization. The effects of

"A high-order nonconservative approach for hyperbolic equations in fluid
  dynamics","  It is well known, thanks to Lax-Wendroff theorem, that the local conservation
of a numerical scheme for a conservative hyperbolic system is a simple and
systematic way to guarantee that, if stable, a scheme will provide a sequence
of solutions that will converge to a weak solution of the continuous problem.
In [1], it is shown that a nonconservative scheme will not provide a good
solution. The question of using, nevertheless, a nonconservative formulation of
the system and getting the correct solution has been a long-standing debate. In
this paper, we show how get a relevant weak solution from a pressure-based
formulation of the Euler equations of fluid mechanics. This is useful when
dealing with nonlinear equations of state because it is easier to compute the
internal energy from the pressure than the opposite. This makes it possible to
get oscillation free solutions, contrarily to classical conservative methods.
An extension to multiphase flows is also discussed, as well as a
multidimensional extension.
","A high-order nonconservative approach for hyperbolic equations in fluid
  dynamics is often suggested as the optimal solution to the problem of how to store the flow of liquids. A general solution for this problem could be made by using thermoluminescence, a technique which has received quite a bit of attention in recent decades.

An excellent example of thermodynamic nonresponse to viscous fluids is that of a viscously distributed system like those found in nature, where it can be shown that the solution of the system is highly dependent on the rate at which a portion of fluid is displaced through the fluid to be filled with the water. This is called a high pressure system, and it is the simplest system to study with liquid flow analysis.

"Decentralized Stochastic Control with Partial History Sharing: A Common
  Information Approach","  A general model of decentralized stochastic control called partial history
sharing information structure is presented. In this model, at each step the
controllers share part of their observation and control history with each
other. This general model subsumes several existing models of information
sharing as special cases. Based on the information commonly known to all the
controllers, the decentralized problem is reformulated as an equivalent
centralized problem from the perspective of a coordinator. The coordinator
knows the common information and select prescriptions that map each
controller's local information to its control actions. The optimal control
problem at the coordinator is shown to be a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) which is solved using techniques from Markov decision
theory. This approach provides (a) structural results for optimal strategies,
and (b) a dynamic program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers
in the original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various
ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural results
on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach cannot be
obtained by the existing generic approach (the person-by-person approach) for
obtaining structural results in decentralized problems; and the dynamic program
obtained by the proposed approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing
generic approach (the designer's approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in
decentralized problems.

Abstract The study of the origin of information and the emergence of systematic generalisations from that information science model to the knowledge of many applications, including applications to management and information systems. In so doing the focus on the fundamental structure of all information in data science and software engineering is essential, as knowledge is often limited outside its central role where it seems to operate most effectively. The idea is that knowledge needs to be stored not only in its basic form but also in a sort of collective structure, which the individual may have managed within and where he or she may not. This is reflected by the data-driven systems that have emerged from deep deep-learning (DG) and deep neural networks (DSN) projects, with their complex interactions with humans and computers. There are more general rules of thumb than any of this: they must always be in accord with the principles of data analysis, algorithmic control, and knowledge-building principles, but",0.24740347407825392,0.19917011948830093,0.20072336911527555
"Halo Retention and Evolution of Coalescing Compact Binaries in
  Cosmological Simulations of Structure Formation: Implications for Short
  Gamma-Ray Bursts","  Merging compact binaries are the one source of gravitational radiation so far
identified. Because short-period systems which will merge in less than a Hubble
time have already been observed as binary pulsars, they are important both as
gravitational wave sources for observatories such as LIGO but also as
progenitors for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). The fact that these systems
must have large systemic velocities implies that by the time they merge, they
will be far from their formation site. The locations of merging sites depend
sensitively on the gravitational potential of the galaxy host, which until now
has been assumed to be static. Here we refine such calculations to incorporate
the temporal evolution of the host's gravitational potential as well as that of
its nearby neighbors using cosmological simulations of structure formation.
This results in merger site distributions that are more diffusively distributed
with respect to their putative hosts, with locations extending out to distances
of a few Mpc for lighter halos. The degree of mixing between neighboring
compact binary populations computed in this way is severely enhanced in
environments with a high number density of galaxies. We find that SGRB redshift
estimates based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can be very
inaccurate, if progenitor systems inhere large systematic kicks at birth.

flight. In this fluid dynamics video, we present a series of high-speed films
of impacts between mosquitoes and raindrops. We also present drop impacts upon
insect mimics, which are unsupported styrofoam balls of the same mass as
mosquitoes. High-speed videography and particle tracking during collision are
employed to determine the insect position versus time. We determine the
magnitude of acceleration by considering the momentum transfer and impact
duration. Experiments with live mosquitoes indicate a surprising ability to
quickly recover flight post-collision, despite accelerations of 30-300
gravities over durations of 1 ms.

Visual Words for Automatic Lip-Reading,"  Lip reading is used to understand or interpret speech without hearing it, a
technique especially mastered by people with hearing difficulties. The ability
to lip read enables a person with a hearing impairment to communicate with

Recent advances in the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, and
signal processing has led to a growing interest in automating this challenging
task of lip reading. Indeed, automating the human ability to lip read, a
process referred to as visual speech recognition, could open the door for other
novel applications. This thesis investigates various issues faced by an
automated lip-reading system and proposes a novel ""visual words"" based approach
to automatic lip reading. The proposed approach includes a novel automatic face

On the class of caustic on the moduli space of odd spin curves,"  Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 3$ and let $\eta$ be an
odd theta characteristic on it such that $h^0(C,\eta) = 1$. Pick a point $p$
from the support of $\eta$ and consider the one-dimensional linear system
$|\eta + p|$. In general this linear system is base-point free and all its
ramification points (i.e. ramification points of the corresponding branched
cover $C\to\mathbb P^1\simeq \mathbb PH^0(C,\eta+p)$) are simple. We study the
locus in the moduli space of odd spin curves where the linear system $|\eta +
p|$ fails to have this general behavior. This locus splits into a union of
three divisors: the first divisor corresponds to the case when $|\eta+p|$ has a
base point, the second one corresponds to theta characteristics which are not
reduced at $p$ (and therefore $|\eta + p|$ must have a triple point at $p$) and
the third one corresponds to the case when $|\eta + p|$ has a triple point
different from $p$. The second divisor was studied by G. Farkas and A. Verra
in\cite{FARo} where its expansion in the rational Picard group was used to
prove that the moduli space of odd spin curves is of general type for genus at
least $12$. We call the first divisor a Base Point divisor and the third one a
Caustic divisor (following Arnold terminology for Hurwitz spases). The
objective of this paper is to expand these two divisors via the set of standard
generators in the rational Picard group of the moduli space of odd spin curves.
","On the class of caustic on the moduli space of odd spin curves, it became clear that quantum computation is an important development in quantum mechanics. One of the main criticisms of this paper is that one doesn't really have a good way of observing the quantum effects of a field. However, the concept of 'unstable' field models may provide a natural starting point for the present investigation. In spite of those doubts, this article by Prof. Ramanathan Verma has suggested a quantum computing model with very good experimental capabilities.

We first consider an experimental, one-time calculation of ground friction of different spin points. Based on experimental results, we demonstrate the necessity of taking a physical approach to ground forces in a practical model of quantum physics. The main experimental parameters:
 and the coefficient of friction. This is shown to be a measure of local gravity. To achieve a well-known field theory with the necessary experimental knowledge, let us take a few steps backward.

Characterization and Photometric Membership of the Open Cluster NGC1981,"  Open clusters belonging to star-forming complexes are the leftovers from the
initial stellar generations. The study of these young systems provides
constraints to models of star formation and evolution as well as to the
properties of the Galactic disc. We aimed at investigating NGC1981, a young
open cluster in the Orion Nebula Region, using near-IR and BV (RI)C photometric
data.We devised a method that accounts for the field contamination and allows
to derive photometric membership for the cluster stars. A new cluster centre
was determined by Gaussian fittings to the 2-D stellar distribution on the sky,
and has been used used to obtain the radial stellar density profile and the
structural parameters. Mass functions were computed for stars inside the
cluster limiting radius and total mass estimated from them. Although more
easily distinguished by its grouping of 6 relatively bright stars, an
underlying population of faint pre-main sequence stars is evident in the
cluster area. We showed that this population is related to the cluster itself
rather than to the nearby Orion Nebula cluster. Additionally a fraction of the
cluster low mass stars may have been evaporated from the region in its early
evolution leading to the present sparse, loose structure. The estimated
parameters of NGC1981 are core radius Rc = 0.09 +/- 0.04 pc, limiting radius
Rlim = 1.21+/-0.11 pc, age t = 5+/-1 Myr, distance modulus (m-M)0 = 7.9+/-0.1

Discretisations of rough stochastic PDEs,"  We develop a general framework for spatial discretisations of parabolic
stochastic PDEs whose solutions are provided in the framework of the theory of
regularity structures and which are functions in time. As an application, we
show that the dynamical $\Phi^4_3$ model on the dyadic grid converges after
renormalisation to its continuous counterpart. This result in particular
implies that, as expected, the $\Phi^4_3$ measure with a sufficiently small
coupling constant is invariant for this equation and that the lifetime of its
solutions is almost surely infinite for almost every initial condition.
","Discretisations of rough stochastic PDEs have also been studied for centuries (Levin & Moore 2000). The question of how important an impact does the PPE have on other phenomena, or at least with respect to the nature of the data, continues to be a subject which is controversial.

on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Among them, AlV$_2$O$_4$ and
LiV$_2$O$_4$ exhibit contrasting and puzzling behavior: self-organization of
seven-site clusters and heavy fermion behavior. We theoretically perform a
comparative study of charge-spin-orbital fluctuations in these two compounds,
on the basis of the multiband Hubbard models constructed by using the
maximally-localized Wannier functions obtained from the ab initio band
calculations. Performing the eigenmode analysis of the generalized
susceptibility, we find that, in AlV$_2$O$_4$, the relevant fluctuation appears
in the charge sector in $\sigma$-bonding type orbitals. In contrast, in
LiV$_2$O$_4$, optical-type spin fluctuations in the $a_{\rm 1g}$ orbital are
enhanced at an incommensurate wave number at low temperature. Implications from
the comparative study are discussed for the contrasting behavior, including the

Instability of rotating black holes: large D analysis,"  We study the stability of odd-dimensional rotating black holes with equal
angular momenta by performing an expansion in the inverse of the number of
dimensions D. Universality at large $D$ allows us to calculate analytically the
complex frequency of quasinormal modes to next-to-leading order in the
expansion. We identify the onset of non-axisymmetric, bar-mode instabilities at
a specific finite rotation, and axisymmetric instabilities at larger rotation.
The former occur at the threshold where the modes become superradiant, and
before the ultraspinning regime is reached. Our results fully confirm the
picture found in numerical studies, with very good quantitative agreement. We
extend the analysis to the same class of black holes in Anti-deSitter space,
and find the same qualitative features. We also discuss the appearance at high
frequencies of the universal set of (stable) quasinormal modes.

Progressive transformation of a flux rope to an ICME,"  The solar wind conditions at one astronomical unit (AU) can be strongly
disturbed by the interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset,
called magnetic clouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an
important amount of magnetic flux and helicity which is released in CMEs. At 1
AU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting
their expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs
present a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and
significantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 and 10
November, 2004. After determining an approximated orientation for the flux rope
using the minimum variance method, we precise the orientation of the cloud axis
relating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method.
This method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux
between the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact
parameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft
trajectory and the cloud axis). Moreover, using the direct method, we find that
the ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent
magnetic region. These observations are interpreted considering the existence
of a previous larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its
environment in the front. These findings imply that the ejected flux rope is
progressively peeled by reconnection and transformed to the observed ICME (with
a remnant flux rope in the front part).

Circular chromatic number of induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs,"  Investigating the equality of the chromatic number and the circular chromatic
number of graphs has been an active stream of research for last decades. In
this regard, Habolhassan and Zhu [Circular chromatic number of Kneser graphs,
Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B, 2003] proved that if $n$ is
sufficiently large with respect to $k$, then the Schrijver graph ${\rm
SG}(n,k)$ has the same chromatic and circular chromatic number. Later, Meunier
[A topological lower bound for the circular chromatic number of Schrijver
graphs, Journal of Graph Theory, 2005] and independently, Simonyi and Tardos [
Local chromatic number, Ky Fan's theorem and circular colorings, Combinatorica,

In this paper, we study the circular chromatic number of induced subgraphs of
Kneser graphs. In this regard, we shall first generalize the preceding result
to $s$-stable Kneser graphs. Furthermore, as a generalization of Hajiabolhassan

then any sufficiently large induced subgraph of the Kneser graph ${\rm

Super-sequences in the arc component of a compact connected group,"  Let G be an abelian topological group. The symbol \hat{G} denotes the group
of all continuous characters \chi : G --> T endowed with the compact open
topology. A subset E of G is said to be qc-dense in G provided that \chi(E)
\subseteq \phi([-1/4,1/4]) holds only for the trivial character \chi \in
\hat{G}, where \phi : R --> T = R/Z is the canonical homomorphism. A
super-sequence is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space S with at most one
non-isolated point (to which S converges). We prove that an infinite compact
abelian group G is connected if and only if its arc component G_a contains a
super-sequence converging to 0 that is qc-dense in G. This gives as a corollary
a recent theorem of Aussenhofer: For a connected locally compact abelian group
G, the restriction homomorphism r : \hat{G} --> \hat{G}_a defined by r(\chi) =
\chi\restriction_{G_a} for \chi \in \hat{G}, is a topological isomorphism. We
also show that an infinite compact group G is connected if and only if its arc
component G_a contains a super-sequence S converging to the identity e that
generates a dense subgroup of G (equivalently, S \setminus {e} is an infinite
suitable set for G in the sense of Hofmann and Morris).

X-ray spectroscopy of the hot has in the M31 bulge,"  We present an X-ray spectroscopic study of the nuclear region of the M31
bulge, based on observations of the Xmm-Newton Reflection Grating
Spectrometers. The obtained high-resolution grating spectra clearly show
individual emission lines of highly-ionized iron and oxygen, which
unambiguously confirm the presence of diffuse hot gas in the bulge, as
indicated from previous X-ray CCD imaging studies. We model the spectra with
detailed Monte-Carlo simulations, which provide a robust spectroscopic estimate
of the hot gas temperature $\sim0.29$ keV and the O/Fe ratio $\sim0.3$ solar.
The results indicate that iron ejecta of type Ia supernovae are partly-mixed
with the hot gas. The observed spectra show an intensity excess at the OVII
triplet, which most likely represents emission from charge exchanges at the
interface between the hot gas and a known cool gas spiral in the same nuclear
region.

observations of the z~11 candidate galaxy strongly lensed by the

that these early slitless grism observations are of sufficient depth to
investigate whether this high-redshift candidate, identified by its strong
photometric break at ~1.5 micron, could possibly be an emission line galaxy at
a much lower redshift. While such an interloper would imply the existence of a
rather peculiar object, we show here that such strong emission lines would
clearly have been detected. Comparing realistic, two-dimensional simulations to
these new observations we would expect the necessary emission lines to be
detected at >5 sigma while we see no evidence for such lines in the dispersed
data of any of the three lensed images. We therefore exclude that this object
could be a low redshift emission line interloper, which significantly increases
the likelihood of this candidate being a bona fide z~11 galaxy.

Nonlinear simulations of the convection-pulsation coupling,"  In cold Cepheids close to the red edge of the classical instability strip, a
strong coupling between the stellar pulsations and the surface convective
motions occurs. This coupling is by now poorly described by 1-D models of
convection, the so-called ""time-dependent convection models"" (TDC). The
intrinsic weakness of such models comes from the large number of unconstrained
free parameters entering in the description of turbulent convection. A way to
overcome these limits is to compute two-dimensional direct simulations (DNS),
in which all the nonlinearities are correctly solved. Two-dimensional DNS of
the convection-pulsation coupling are presented here. In an appropriate
parameter regime, convective motions can actually quench the radial pulsations
of the star, as suspected in Cepheids close to the red edge of the instability
strip. These nonlinear simulations can also be used to determine the limits and
the relevance of the TDC models.
","Nonlinear simulations of the convection-pulsation coupling of a tectonic plate coupled with a convective plate are described. The combined conveicular and eccentric directions of tector walls, interverse edges, lateral transverse curvature, and polar positions of interannular tucts were verified by a computational algorithm.

Results from this series provide evidence of this effect, with t-type boundary conditions for the two convections (P = 0.024) and the interactions of two transgeometric boundaries (T = 7.4) demonstrating that t axis is a weak coupling.

"Which type of citation analysis generates the most accurate taxonomy of
  scientific and technical knowledge?","  In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy
of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for
science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to
be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing
citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories.
Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous
work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those
studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the
accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using
direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new
gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct
citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic
coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of
references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more
accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge
than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that
discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate
compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.
","Which type of citation analysis generates the most accurate taxonomy of
  scientific and technical knowledge? The answer is 'in fact.' We're talking about the taxonomies of every scientific work that is considered a scientific knowledge. All kinds of work must be classified in these categories. I think we need to be careful about interpreting the kinds or kinds and definitions that are given in that section of each book, and in the sections that we review by different groups and subgroups.

I've tried to explain the difference with many different terms, but in many ways I'm arguing the fundamental question here, is there a distinction between technical and nontechnical knowledge, or something more than either?

"Augmented Reality Meets Computer Vision : Efficient Data Generation for
  Urban Driving Scenes","  The success of deep learning in computer vision is based on availability of
large annotated datasets. To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually
rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Creating realistic 3D
content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In
this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic
data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models.
Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for
this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the
target category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap,
and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating
complex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to
augment real images with virtual objects. This allows us to create realistic
composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance and a large
number of complex object arrangements. In contrast to modeling complete 3D
environments, our augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions
in combination with 3D shapes of the target object. Through extensive
experimentation, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented
data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation
models. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on training
standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of
cars in outdoor driving scenes. We test the models trained on our augmented
data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate
ground truth, and on Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that
models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on
synthetic data or models trained on limited amount of annotated real data.

"Wetting in a two-dimensional capped capillary. Part II: Three-phase
  coexistence","  In Part II of this study we consider two cases of three-phase coexistence.
First, the capped capillary may allow for vapour, drop-like, and slab-like
phases to coexist at the same values of temperature and chemical potential.
Second, the slit pore forming the bulk of the capped capillary may allow for
the coexistence between vapour, planar prewetting film and capillary-liquid.
While the consideration of the former case allows us to summarise the
phenomenology presented in Part I and to show that the transition line of wedge
prewetting is shifted in capillary-like geometries by a constant value,
depending on the capillary width, the careful examination of the latter case
allows us to uncover a new phase transition in confined fluids, a continuous
planar prewetting transition. A planar prewetting transition is known to be a
distinctly first-order phenomenon, and typically taking place on the scale of
several atomic diameters. A continuous prewetting transition, on the other
hand, is scale invariant. Thus, apart from being of fundamental significance,
this finding has potential for facilitating experimental detection as well as
measurements of planar prewetting. Further, we provide proof for the existence
of a tri-critical point of the three-phase coexistence line of the capped
capillary while by considering a dynamic model of wetting we show how the
relaxation of the system can be pinned by a metastable state. We present a full
parametric study of our model system and support our findings with exhaustive
examples of density profiles, adsorption and free energy isotherms, and full
phase diagrams.

- There are two main types of single-capillary co-combustion: two-, four-, and ten-D. It should be noted that any of the points and points of contact have a different density, which may differ from one capility type to another. The common method for determining the density in two capilites is by means of three-way interaction; in the first a single point (a cap in which some energy is transferred from the energy of neighboring capils and the other points into the opposite capile) has higher density than a smaller point, and with lower and higher densities, even though the cap is in opposite. This gives rise to the famous problem of ""partly polarized"" capillation. In this case, either the point itself or the source of light is not present.

nonequilibrium heat exchange between a conduction band and a bosonic bath
mediated by a single molecule. For molecules large enough so that on-site
interactions can be dropped we carry out an asymptotically exact calculation of
the heat current, governed by the smallness of the electron-phonon coupling,
and obtain the steady state heat current driven by a finite temperature drop.
At low temperatures the heat current is found to have a power-law behavior with
respect to the temperature difference with the power depending on the nature of
the bosonic bath. At high temperatures, on the other hand, the current is
linear in the temperature difference for all types of bosonic baths. The
crossover between these behaviors is described. Some of the results are given a

Random walk based in-network computation of arbitrary functions,"  We study in-network computation on general network topologies. Specifically,
we are given the description of a function, and a network with distinct nodes
at which the operands of the function are made available, and a designated sink
where the computed value of the function is to be consumed. We want to compute
the function during the process of moving the data towards the sink. Such
settings have been studied in the literature, but mainly for symmetric
functions, e.g. average, parity etc., which have the specific property that the
output is invariant to permutation of the operands. To the best of our
knowledge, we present the first fully decentralised algorithms for arbitrary
functions, which we model as those functions whose computation schema is
structured as a binary tree. We propose two algorithms, Fixed Random-Compute
and Flexible Random-Compute, for this problem, both of which use simple random
walks on the network as their basic primitive. Assuming a stochastic model for
the generation of streams of data at each source, we provide a lower and an
upper bound on the rate at which Fixed Random-Compute can compute the stream of
associated function values. Note that the lower bound on rate though computed
for our algorithm serves as a general lower bound for the function computation
problem and to the best of our knowledge is first such lower bound for
asymmetric functions. We also provide upper bounds on the average time taken to
compute the function, characterising this time in terms of the fundamental
parameters of the random walk on the network: the hitting time in the case of
Fixed Random-Compute, and the mixing time in the case of Flexible
Random-Compute.
","Random walk based in-network computation of arbitrary functions of time on time is done using standard algorithms. It does this because it is possible to create arbitrarily sized variables. The basic approach can be seen as the following, if you have an arbitrary time in your database and you like the way the network interacts with your data (or you simply get lost) then this method is no different. We will look at this more about the approach from the beginning.

"Two-Stage Stochastic International Portfolio Optimisation under
  Regular-Vine-Copula-Based Scenarios","  In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic international portfolio
optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both
assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a
""currency overlay"", or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to
provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency
exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are
also included.
  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return
distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine
copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of
the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and
asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the
uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio
optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated
from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a
standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the
proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios
that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario
generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return
compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher
returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in
uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.

Continuum models of collective cell migration,"  Collective cell migration plays a central role in tissue development,
morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer progression. With the growing
realization that physical forces mediate cell motility in development and
physiology, a key biological question is how cells integrate molecular
activities for force generation on multicellular scales. In this review we
discuss recent advances in modeling collective cell migration using
quantitative tools and approaches rooted in soft matter physics. We focus on
theoretical models of cell aggregates as continuous active media, where the
feedback between mechanical forces and regulatory biochemistry gives rise to
rich collective dynamical behavior. This class of models provides a powerful
predictive framework for the physiological dynamics that underlies many
developmental processes, where cells need to collectively migrate like a
viscous fluid to reach a target region, and then stiffen to support mechanical
stresses and maintain tissue cohesion.
","Continuum models of collective cell migration have been discovered in the human genome following successful experiments. A subset of these models, now called hybrid genomes, use a genetic map that maps the genetic code to known, independent factors to generate individual cells.

The hybrid genome is a complete computer model that identifies a set of ""guidelines"" required in a given community for each population and provides genetic information for specific cells that provide a particular health risk. The guidelines can be determined by computer models that predict a population's cell populations accurately or by analyzing data from a variety of genome databases. By using these databases and other sources of data to determine the health risks of individuals and to calculate their relative mobility,",0.2339129451301,0.14358973865930327,0.17382594378625146
"Automation of Mobile Pick and Place Robotic System for Small Food
  Industry","  The use of robotics in food industry is becoming more popular in recent
years. The trend seems to continue as long as the robotics technology meets

synchronously by recourse to null events that keep all processors time clocks

a chessboard decomposition into non-interacting sublattices. We find that the
bias introduced by the spatial correlations attendant to the sublattice
decomposition is within the standard deviation of the serial method, which
confirms the statistical validity of the method. We have assessed the parallel
efficiency of the method and find that our algorithm scales consistently with
problem size and sublattice partition. We apply the method to the calculation

Anomaly in the heat capacity of Kondo superconductors,"  Using numerical renormalization group we study thermodynamic properties of a
magnetic impurity described by the Anderson impurity model in a superconducting
host material described by the BCS Hamiltonian. When the Kondo temperature in
the normal state, T_K, is comparable to the critical temperature of the
superconducting transition, T_c, the magnetic doublet state may become
degenerate with the Kondo singlet state, leading to a ln3 peak in the
temperature dependence of the impurity contribution to the entropy. This
entropy increase translates into an anomalous feature in the heat capacity
which might have already been experimentally observed.

"Multi-height Scattering Phase Shifts From Sunspots And Phase Differences
  Between Photospheric Heights With SDO/HMI and AIA Data","  Following Couvidat (2013), we analyze data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instruments onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory: Doppler velocity and continuum intensity at 6173 A
as well as intensity maps at 1600 A and 1700 A. Datasets of 14 active regions
and four quiet-Sun regions are studied at four heights in the solar
photosphere. An Hankel-Fourier analysis is performed around these regions of
interest. Outgoing-ingoing scattering phase shifts at a given atmospheric
height are computed, as well as ingoing-ingoing and outgoing-outgoing phase
differences between two atmospheric heights. The outgoing-ingoing phase shifts
produced by sunspots show little dependence on measurement height, unlike the
acoustic power reduction measured in Couvidat (2013). Phenomena happening above
continuum level, like acoustic glories, appear not to have a significant effect
on the phases. However there is a strong dependence on sunspot size,
line-of-sight magnetic flux, and intensity contrast. As previously suggested by
other groups, the region of wave scattering appears both horizontally smaller
and vertically less extended than the region of acoustic power suppression, and
occurs closer to the surface. Results presented here should help refine
theoretical models of acoustic wave scattering by magnetic fields.
Ingoing-ingoing phase differences between two measurement heights are also
computed and show a complex pattern highly dependent on atmospheric height. In
particular, a significant sensitivity of AIA signals to lower chromospheric
layers is shown. Finally, ingoing-ingoing minus outgoing-outgoing phase
differences between various measurement heights are discussed.

 This paper describes an approach to calculate SD/hMI data using the common data used in optical and magnetic imaging. Although the SD data are quite different, they do support two different approaches to understand the differences between surface, optical, and radio data. 1. Comparison of images captured at different angles (at different frequencies) in the same optical data sources The comparison of surfaces and optical images can involve differences in many locations in space, but in all optical sources, the two data types work much similarly. The two surface data systems can also have differing degrees of variability. Differences in temperature extremes can be caused by different components of each optical source or, in rare occlusion, by differences of ambient temperature. 2. Differential analysis of the satellite spectrum for the solar array is a difficult task.

Observing the shadow of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion black hole,"  In this paper, the shadows cast by Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion black hole
and naked singularity are studied. The shadow of a rotating black hole is found
to be a dark zone covered by a deformed circle. For a fixed value of the spin
$a$, the size of the shadow decreases with the dilaton parameter $b$. The
distortion of the shadow monotonically increases with $b$ and takes its maximal
when the black hole approaches to the extremal case. Due to the optical
properties, the area of the black hole shadow is supposed to equal to the
high-energy absorption cross section. Based on this assumption, the energy
emission rate is investigated. For a naked singularity, the shadow has a dark
arc and a dark spot or straight, and the corresponding observables are
obtained. These results show that there is a significant effect of the spin $a$
and dilaton parameter $b$ on these shadows. Moreover, we examine the
observables of the shadow cast by the supermassive black hole at the center of
the Milky Way, which is very useful for us to probe the nature of the black
hole through the astronomical observations in the near future.

A Phenomenological Cost Model for High Energy Particle Accelerators,"  Accelerator-based high-energy physics have been in the forefront of
scientific discoveries for more than half a century. The accelerator technology
of the colliders has progressed immensely, while the beam energy, luminosity,
facility size, and cost have grown by several orders of magnitude. The method
of colliding beams has not fully exhausted its potential but has slowed down
considerably in its progress. In this paper we derive a simple scaling model
for the cost of large accelerators and colliding beam facilities based on costs
of 17 big facilities which have been either built or carefully estimated.
Although this approach cannot replace an actual cost estimate based on an
engineering design, this parameterization is to indicate a somewhat realistic
cost range for consideration of what future frontier accelerator facilities
might be fiscally realizable.

Charge Stripes in the Two-Orbital Hubbard Model for Pnictides,"  The two-orbital Hubbard model for the pnictides is studied numerically using
the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation on finite clusters. Upon electron
doping, states with a nonuniform distribution of charge are stabilized. The
observed patterns correspond to charge stripes oriented perpendicular to the

charge striped states are robust when the undoped state has a Hubbard gap,
their existence when the intermediate-coupling magnetic metallic state of
pnictides is doped was also observed for particular model parameters. Results

Shining Flavor and Radion Phenomenology in Warped Extra Dimension,"  We study radion phenomenology in the context of flavor shining in warped
extra dimension models. In this unique setup, originally proposed by Rattazzi
and Zaffaroni, solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and the new physics
flavor problem are unified. A special role is played by the vacuum energy on
the branes, that naturally allows for flavon stabilization and parametrically
raises the radion mass. We note that the radion mass squared is suppressed only
by the log of the weak-Planck hierarchy, and it is in the favored range of the
standard model Higgs. We emphasize that the radion to di-photon, to tau tau and
to WW^* can be promising discovery channels at the LHC, with a rate above that
of the standard model Higgs. We find that the radion is unlikely to account for
the excess in W plus dijet events as recently reported by the CDF
collaboration.

They would represent the best tool to infer the structure and dynamics of the

yet been calculated, we have to understand the effect of these modes, and also
low-degree high-frequency p modes, on the inversion of the solar rotation rate

  Cancri System","  We report in this paper the numerical simulations of the capture into the 3:1
mean-motion resonance between the planet b and c in the 55 Cancri system. The
results show that this resonance can be obtained by a differential planetary
migration. The moderate initial eccentricities, relatively slower migration and
suitable eccentricity damping rate increase significantly the probability of
being trapped in this resonance. Otherwise, the system crosses the 3:1
commensurability avoiding resonance capture, to be eventually captured into a
2:1 resonance or some other higher-order resonances. After the resonance
capture, the system could jump from one orbital configuration to another one if
the migration continues, making a large region of the configuration space
accessible for a resonance system. These investigations help us understand the
diversity of resonance configurations and put some constrains on the early
dynamical evolution of orbits in the extra-solar planetary systems.

Open questions on the impact of an inflated ball,"  The behaviour of sports balls during impact defines some special features of
each sport. The velocity of the game, the accuracy of passes or shots, the
control of the ball direction after impact, the risks of injury, are all set by
the impact mechanics of the ball. For inflated sports balls, those
characteristics are finely tuned by the ball inner pressure. As a consequence,
inflation pressures are regulated for sports played with inflated balls.
Despite a good understanding of ball elasticity, the source of energy
dissipation for inflated balls remains controversial. We first give a clear
view of non-dissipative impact mechanics. Second we review, analyse and
estimate the different sources of energy dissipation of the multi-physics
phenomena that occur during the impact. Finally, we propose several experiments
to decide between gas compression, shell visco-elastic dissipation, solid
friction, sound emission or shell vibrations as the major source of energy
dissipation.

"A Structural and Algorithmic Study of Stable Matching Lattices of
  ""Nearby"" Instances, with Applications","  Recently MV18 identified and initiated work on the new problem of
understanding structural relationships between the lattices of solutions of two
""nearby"" instances of stable matching. They also gave an application of their
work to finding a robust stable matching. However, the types of changes they
allowed in going from instance $A$ to $B$ were very restricted, namely any one
agent executes an upward shift. In this paper, we allow any one agent to
permute its preference list arbitrarily. Let $M_A$ and $M_B$ be the sets of
stable matchings of the resulting pair of instances $A$ and $B$, and let
$\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ be the corresponding lattices of stable
matchings. We prove that the matchings in $M_A \cap M_B$ form a sublattice of
both $\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ and those in $M_A \setminus M_B$ form
a join semi-sublattice of $\mathcal{L}_A$. These properties enable us to obtain
a polynomial time algorithm for not only finding a stable matching in $M_A \cap
M_B$, but also for obtaining the partial order, as promised by Birkhoff's
Representation Theorem, thereby enabling us to generate all matchings in this
sublattice. Our algorithm also helps solve a version of the robust stable

new insights into the incentive compatibility properties of the Gale-Shapley

irregular galaxy ESO 324-G024 which is seen in projection against the giant,
northern lobe of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A, NGC 5128). The distorted
morphology and kinematics of ESO 324-G024, as observed in the 21 cm spectral

investigate whether tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping are
responsible for the formation of the HI tail stretching to the northeast of ESO

the sub-structure of Cen A's polarized radio lobes to ascertain whether ESO

multi-wavelength, multi-component approach allows us to determine that ESO
324-G024 is most likely behind the northern radio lobe of Cen A. This result
helps to constrain the orientation of the lobe, which is likely inclined to our

A Two-Dimensional Lattice Ion Trap for Quantum Simulation,"  Quantum simulations of spin systems could enable the solution of problems
which otherwise require infeasible classical resources. Such a simulation may
be implemented using a well-controlled system of effective spins, such as a
two-dimensional lattice of locally interacting ions. We propose here a layered
planar rf trap design that can be used to create arbitrary two-dimensional
lattices of ions. The design also leads naturally to ease of microfabrication.
As a first experimental demonstration, we confine strontium-88 ions in a
mm-scale lattice trap and verify numerical models of the trap by measuring the
motional frequencies. We also confine 440 nm diameter charged microspheres and
observe ion-ion repulsion between ions in neighboring lattice sites. Our
design, when scaled to smaller ion-ion distances, is appropriate for quantum
simulation schemes, e.g. that of Porras and Cirac (PRL 92 207901 (2004)). We
note, however, that in practical realizations of the trap, an increase in the
secular frequency with decreasing ion spacing may make a coupling rate that is
large relative to the decoherence rate in such a trap difficult to achieve.

"Velocity, temperature and normal force dependence on friction: An
  analytical and molecular dynamic study","  In this work we propose an extension to the analytical one-dimensional model
proposed by E. Gnecco (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84:1172) to describe friction. Our
model includes normal forces and the dependence with the angular direction of
movement in which the object is dragged over a surface. The presence of the
normal force in the model allow us to define judiciously the friction
coefficient, instead of introducing it as an {\sl a posteriori} concept. We
compare the analytical results with molecular dynamics simulations. The
simulated model corresponds to a tip sliding over a surface. The tip is
simulated as a single particle interacting with a surface through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. The surface is considered as consisting of a
regular BCC(001) arrangement of particles interacting with each other through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. We investigate the system under several
conditions of velocity, temperature and normal forces. Our analytical results
are in very good agreement with those obtained by the simulations and with
experimental results from E. Riedo (Phys. Rev. Lett. 91:084502) and Eui-Sung
Yoon (Wear 259:1424-1431) as well.

Assuming that temperature remains stable at a constant constant for a few seconds (in this case, when the body is at room temperature), we observe an inelastic (and nonlinear) kinetic expansion through the skin (Fig. 2).

Plastic flow in solids with interfaces,"  A non-equilibrium theory of isothermal and diffusionless evolution of
incoherent interfaces within a plastically deforming solid is developed. The
irreversible dynamics of the interface are driven by its normal motion,
incoherency (slip and misorientation), and an intrinsic plastic flow; and
purely by plastic deformation in the bulk away from the interface. Using the
continuum theory for defect distribution (in bulk and over the interface) we
formulate a general kinematical framework, derive relevant balance laws and

"Measurability Aspects of the Compactness Theorem for Sample Compression
  Schemes","  It was proved in 1998 by Ben-David and Litman that a concept space has a
sample compression scheme of size d if and only if every finite subspace has a

at the same time measurability of the hypotheses is a necessary condition for

"Serum protein resistant behavior of multisite-bound poly(ethylene
  glycol) chains onto iron oxide surfaces","  Recent surveys have shown that the number of nanoparticle-based formulations
actually used at the clinical level is significantly lower than expected a
decade ago. One reason for this is that the nanoparticle physicochemical
properties fall short for handling the complexity of biological environments
and for preventing nonspecific protein adsorption. In this study, we address
the issue of the interactions of plasma proteins with polymer coated surfaces.
To this aim, we use a non-covalent grafting-to method to functionalize iron
oxide sub-10 nm nanoparticles and iron oxide flat substrates, and compare their
protein responses. The functionalized copolymers consist in alternating
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains and phosphonic acid grafted on the same
backbone. Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation was used to monitor the
polymer adsorption kinetics and to evaluate the resistance to protein
adsorption. On flat substrates, functionalized PEG copolymers adsorb and form a
brush in the moderate or in the highly stretched regimes, with density between
0.15 and 1.5 nm-2. PEG layers using phosphonic acid as linkers exhibit
excellent protein resistance. In contrast, layers prepared with carboxylic acid
as grafting agent exhibit mitigated protein responses and layer
destructuration. The present study establishes a correlation between the
long-term stability of PEG coated particles in biofluids and the protein
resistance of surfaces coated with the same polymers.

3. In conclusion, our results suggest that polysaccharides have a negative effect on the cellular metabolism of iron oxides as in our study, but this effect was not present in other cells. The role of monolayer residues in the metabolism induced by iron monodeoxygenase activity are difficult to address because of the lack of a molecular mechanism of action. Here, this may be partially due to the fact that monosucrose is required for these essential functional properties, rather than the more obvious effects of its monovalent application on iron phosphate, which do not play a role in iron oxidation. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies to iron sulfide complexes also contribute to oxidative stress in this way. Thus the negative effects",0.21503446512072388,0.17213114261656826,0.19707922129574554
"Quantum Information at the Interface of Light with Atomic Ensembles and

It was discovered recently that this type of light-matter interaction can
actually be tuned to realize more general dynamics, enabling better performance
of the light-matter interface as well as rendering tasks possible, which were
before thought to be impractical. This includes the realization of improved
entanglement assisted and backaction evading magnetometry approaching the
Quantum Cramer-Rao limit, quantum memory for squeezed states of light and the

Mott-Anderson transition. Our findings are based on a combination of numerical
and analytical results obtained within the framework of Typical-Medium Theory

capable of incorporating Anderson localization effects. By making use of
previous scaling studies of Anderson impurity models close to the

result is that, for sufficiently strong disorder, the Mott-Anderson transition
is characterized by a precisely defined two-fluid behavior, in which only a

Sequentially split $*$-homomorphisms between $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras,"  We define and examine sequentially split $*$-homomorphisms between
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras and $\mathrm{C}^*$-dynamical systems. For a
$*$-homomorphism, the property of being sequentially split can be regarded as
an approximate weakening of being a split-injective inclusion of
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We show for a sequentially split $*$-homomorphism that
a multitude of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic approximation properties pass from the
target algebra to the domain algebra, including virtually all important
approximation properties currently used in the classification theory of
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We also discuss various settings in which sequentially
split $*$-homomorphisms arise naturally from context. One particular class of
examples arises from compact group actions with the Rokhlin property. This
allows us to recover and extend the presently known permanence properties of
Rokhlin actions with a unified conceptual approach and a simple proof.
Moreover, this perspective allows us to obtain new results about such actions,

"Do semidefinite relaxations solve sparse PCA up to the information
  limit?","  Estimating the leading principal components of data, assuming they are
sparse, is a central task in modern high-dimensional statistics. Many
algorithms were developed for this sparse PCA problem, from simple diagonal
thresholding to sophisticated semidefinite programming (SDP) methods. A key
theoretical question is under what conditions can such algorithms recover the
sparse principal components? We study this question for a single-spike model
with an $\ell_0$-sparse eigenvector, in the asymptotic regime as dimension $p$
and sample size $n$ both tend to infinity. Amini and Wainwright [Ann. Statist.
37 (2009) 2877-2921] proved that for sparsity levels $k\geq\Omega(n/\log p)$,
no algorithm, efficient or not, can reliably recover the sparse eigenvector. In
contrast, for $k\leq O(\sqrt{n/\log p})$, diagonal thresholding is consistent.
It was further conjectured that an SDP approach may close this gap between
computational and information limits. We prove that when
$k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, the proposed SDP approach, at least in its standard
usage, cannot recover the sparse spike. In fact, we conjecture that in the
single-spike model, no computationally-efficient algorithm can recover a spike
of $\ell_0$-sparsity $k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we present empirical
results suggesting that up to sparsity levels $k=O(\sqrt{n})$, recovery is
possible by a simple covariance thresholding algorithm.

An X-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4Ms CDFS observations,"  [Abridged] We use the large public spectroscopic database available in the
GOODS-South field to estimate the dynamical mass and the virialization status
of cluster ClG 0332-2747 at z=0.734. Cluster members selected from their
photometric redshift are used with spectroscopic ones to analyse the galaxy
population of the cluster. In the newly released Chandra 4Ms observations we
detect a faint extended X-ray emission associated to the cluster. Finally, we
compare the optical and X-ray properties of ClG 0332-2747 with the predictions
of a well tested semianalytic model. We estimate the velocity dispersion and
the virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequence
members only. We obtain sigma_v=634 +/- 105 Km/s, M_200=3.07
^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} M_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values in
the latter case. The cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: it
shows a perfectly Gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence for
substructures. ClG 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,
and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} M_sun) old brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. We detect a faint
extended X-ray source centered on the BCG, with a total X-ray luminosity of L_X
~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 keV). This L_X is lower by a factor of ~10-20
than expected according to the M-L_X relation. We provide a possible
explanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of AGN feedback on the
ICM: the semianalytic model reproduces the M-L_X relation measured from ""X-ray
bright"" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heating
and expulsion of the cluster gas. Interestingly, in the model clusters with an
evolved galaxy population like ClG 0332-2747 present the largest scatter in
X-ray luminosity.
","An X-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4Ms CDFS observations will eventually be able to pick out what the massive structures look like. Although this study can take about a year or so, it will be clear that much of what astronomers discover are now a result of previous, well-designed observations, such as the early 1990s, as well as new evidence that the galaxies appear to be in rotation—similar to how we normally think of large objects moving at the speed of light.

"Enhancing quantum control by bootstrapping a quantum processor of 12
  qubits","  Accurate and efficient control of quantum systems is one of the central
challenges for quantum information processing. Current state-of-the-art
experiments rarely go beyond 10 qubits and in most cases demonstrate only
limited control. Here we demonstrate control of a 12-qubit system, and show
that the system can be employed as a quantum processor to optimize its own
control sequence by using measurement-based feedback control (MQFC). The final
product is a control sequence for a complex 12-qubit task: preparation of a
12-coherent state. The control sequence is about 10% more accurate than the one
generated by the standard (classical) technique, showing that MQFC can correct
for unknown imperfections. Apart from demonstrating a high level of control
over a relatively large system, our results show that even at the 12-qubit
level, a quantum processor can be a useful lab instrument. As an extension of
our work, we propose a method for combining the MQFC technique with a twirling
protocol, to optimize the control sequence that produces a desired Clifford
gate.

Blockchain Enabled Enhanced IoT Ecosystem Security,"  Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, is
starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the
Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused
in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof of Work (PoW), a
cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining
a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible.
Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of

the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted
non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof of

"A Study on Unsupervised Dictionary Learning and Feature Encoding for
  Action Classification","  Many efforts have been devoted to develop alternative methods to traditional
vector quantization in image domain such as sparse coding and soft-assignment.
These approaches can be split into a dictionary learning phase and a feature
encoding phase which are often closely connected. In this paper, we investigate
the effects of these phases by separating them for video-based action
classification. We compare several dictionary learning methods and feature
encoding schemes through extensive experiments on KTH and HMDB51 datasets.
Experimental results indicate that sparse coding performs consistently better
than the other encoding methods in large complex dataset (i.e., HMDB51), and it
is robust to different dictionaries. For small simple dataset (i.e., KTH) with
less variation, however, all the encoding strategies perform competitively. In
addition, we note that the strength of sophisticated encoding approaches comes
not from their corresponding dictionaries but the encoding mechanisms, and we
can just use randomly selected exemplars as dictionaries for video-based action
classification.

Characteristics of transverse waves in chromospheric mottles,"  Using data obtained by the high temporal and spatial resolution Rapid
Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument on the Dunn Solar
Telescope, we investigate at an unprecedented level of detail transverse
oscillations in chromospheric fine structures near the solar disk center. The
oscillations are interpreted in terms of propagating and standing
magnetohydrodynamic kink waves. Wave characteristics including the maximum
transverse velocity amplitude and the phase speed are measured as a function of
distance along the structure's length. Solar magneto-seismology is applied to
these measured parameters to obtain diagnostic information on key plasma
parameters (e.g., magnetic field, density, temperature, flow speed) of these
localised waveguides. The magnetic field strength of the mottle along the
$\sim$2 Mm length is found to decrease by a factor of 12, while the local
plasma density scale height is $\sim280\pm$80 km.
","Characteristics of transverse waves in chromospheric mottles is well known from multistep numerical models of the Earth's atmosphere—the model of stellar evolution that results and predicts these waves. In turn, a recent study of these wave signatures suggested that they are not related to the origin of planetary radiation, and that their formation may be caused primarily by the presence of an active, stationary surface or sub-surface core, rather than a supernova or a collision of two protons.1

In this study, published Aug. 27 in Geophysical Research Letters, the work is the first to study wave evolution on the human scale, using single- and dual-",0.22685084621475063,0.16666666174135816,0.15950520833333331
"Interior Models of Saturn: Including the Uncertainties in Shape and
  Rotation","  The accurate determination of Saturn's gravitational coefficients by Cassini
could provide tighter constrains on Saturn's internal structure. Also,
occultation measurements provide important information on the planetary shape
which is often not considered in structure models. In this paper we explore how
wind velocities and internal rotation affect the planetary shape and the
constraints on Saturn's interior. We show that within the geodetic approach
(Lindal et al., 1985, ApJ, 90, 1136) the derived physical shape is insensitive
to the assumed deep rotation. Saturn's re-derived equatorial and polar radii at
100 mbar are found to be 54,445 $\pm$10 km and 60,365$\pm$10 km, respectively.
To determine Saturn's interior we use {\it 1 D} three-layer hydrostatic
structure models, and present two approaches to include the constraints on the
shape. These approaches, however, result in only small differences in Saturn's
derived composition. The uncertainty in Saturn's rotation period is more
significant: with Voyager's 10h39mns period, the derived mass of heavy elements
in the envelope is 0-7 M$_{\oplus}$. With a rotation period of 10h32mns, this
value becomes $<4$ $M_{\oplus}$, below the minimum mass inferred from
spectroscopic measurements. Saturn's core mass is found to depend strongly on
the pressure at which helium phase separation occurs, and is estimated to be
5-20 M$_{\oplus}$. Lower core masses are possible if the separation occurs
deeper than 4 Mbars. We suggest that the analysis of Cassini's radio
occultation measurements is crucial to test shape models and could lead to
constraints on Saturn's rotation profile and departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium.

Landau damping in a collisionless dipolar Bose gas,"  We present a theory for the Landau damping of low energy quasi-particles in a
collisionless, quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas and produce expressions for the
damping rate in uniform and non-uniform systems. Using simple energy-momentum
conservation arguments, we show that in the homogeneous system, the nature of
the low energy dispersion in a dipolar Bose gas severely inhibits Landau
damping of long wave-length excitations. For a gas with contact and dipolar
interactions, the damping rate for phonons tends to decrease with increasing
dipolar interactions; for strong dipole-dipole interactions, phonons are
virtually undamped over a broad range of temperature. The damping rate for
maxon-roton excitations is found to be significantly larger than the damping
rate for phonons.
","Landau damping in a collisionless dipolar Bose gas system would not stop further development of an ocean. Rather, they could accelerate it by a factor of 10 or more, which would increase the value of the solar mass in the atmosphere, increase its gravitational potential in an area under constant pressure, decrease surface temperature, and so on. This scenario would include large amounts of energy and a big impact area to slow down development, as well as the reduction in surface ocean depth—not to mention its dramatic impact on life.

A condensed matter analogy of impact crater formation,"  Impact craters exist on various solid objects in the planetary system. A
simplified analogy of the process of their formation is here analyzed by
standard solid state physics and the so called dynamic quantized fracture
mechanics. An expression which links the crater volume to the parameters of the
impactor and the target is obtained within the two approaches. For low impactor
energy, this expression is of the same mathematical form as the one resulting
from recent experiments.It is shown that the formation of an impact crater is
possible even without heating of the target, if the critical stress in the
target satisfies certain conditions. The critical value of the stress needed
for the occurence of a fracture is calculated for three craters: two
terrestrial and one lunar crater. The approach presented here uses only
measurable material parameters, and is therefore more realistic than the
treatement of the same problem using the cohesive energy of materials.

"A state of the art of urban reconstruction: street, street network,
  vegetation, urban feature","  World population is raising, especially the part of people living in cities.
With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and
their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and
analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally,
much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential
part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom
researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a
unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing
the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by
considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for
city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse
which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street

  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role
the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse
procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to
come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of
the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and
to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural
modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the
reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.

  in water","  Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects on the flow organization in
two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard turbulence are numerically analyzed. The
working fluid is water. We focus on the temperature profiles, the center
temperature, the Nusselt number, and on the analysis of the velocity field.
Several velocity amplitudes (or Reynolds numbers) and several kinetic profiles
are introduced and studied; these together describe the various features of the
rather complex flow organization. The results are presented both as functions
of the Rayleigh number Ra (with Ra up to 10^8) for fixed temperature difference
(Delta) between top and bottom plates and as functions of Delta
(""non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness"") for fixed Ra with Delta up to 60 K. All results
are consistent with the available experimental NOB data for the center
temperature Tc and the Nusselt number ratio Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB} (the label OB
meaning that the Oberbeck-Boussinesq conditions are valid).
  Beyond Ra ~ 10^6 the flow consists of a large diagonal center convection roll
and two smaller rolls in the upper and lower corners. In the NOB case the
center convection roll is still characterized by only one velocity scale.

Proofs of two conjectures on generalized Fibonacci cubes,"  A binary string $f$ is a factor of string $u$ if $f$ appears as a sequence of
$|f|$ consecutive bits of $u$, where $|f|$ denotes the length of $f$.
Generalized Fibonacci cube $Q_{d}(f)$ is the graph obtained from the $d$-cube
$Q_{d}$ by removing all vertices that contain a given binary string $f$ as a
factor. A binary string $f$ is called good if $Q_{d}(f)$ is an isometric
subgraph of $Q_{d}$ for all $d\geq1$, it is called bad otherwise. The index of
a binary string $f$, denoted by $B(f)$, is the smallest integer $d$ such that
$Q_{d}(f)$ is not an isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$. Ili\'{c}, Klav\v{z}ar and
Rho conjectured that $B(f)<2|f|$ for any bad string $f$. They also conjectured
that if $Q_{d}(f)$ is an isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$, then $Q_{d}(ff)$ is an
isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$. We confirm the two conjectures by obtaining a
basic result: if there exist $p$-critical words for $Q_{B(f)}(f)$, then $p$=2
or $p=3$.
","Proofs of two conjectures on generalized Fibonacci cubes are:

1. a proof to be true that the answer was not falsifiable for any other function of the product,
…or, 2. if we are to include the only case where such a fact is also false, we shall find that it was for the sum of many Fibons of various lengths, namely 1, the smallest possible FibON of all functions in the first product.
...and if, with certainty the fact that any of them are also true is true, a second proof is correct. This is the theorem shown in Fig. 3. It does not need proof that every such product is not false.

interacting with a realistic common stationary electromagnetic field out of
thermal equilibrium. In the case of two qubits we show that the absence of

external action on the two qubits. We first give a simple physical
interpretation of the phenomenon in a specific case and then we report a

"On Supersymmetric Geometric Flows and $\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation From
  Scale Invariant Supergravity","  Models of geometric flows pertaining to $\mathcal{R}^2$ scale invariant
(super) gravity theories coupled to conformally invariant matter fields are
investigated. Related to this work are supersymmetric scalar manifolds that are
isomorphic to the K\""{a}hlerian spaces $\mathcal{M}_n=SU(1,1+k)/U(1)\times
SU(1+k)$ as generalizations of the non-supersymmetric analogs with
$SO(1,1+k)/SO(1+k)$ manifolds. For curved superspaces with geometric evolution
of physical objects, a complete supersymmetric theory has to be elaborated on
nonholonomic (super) manifolds and bundles determined by non-integrable
superdistributions with additional constraints on (super) field dynamics and
geometric evolution equations. We also consider generalizations of Perelman's
functionals using such nonholonomic variables which result in the decoupling of
geometric flow equations and Ricci soliton equations with supergravity
modifications of the $R^2$ gravity theory. As such, it is possible to construct
exact non-homogeneous and locally anisotropic cosmological solutions for
various types of (super) gravity theories modelled as modified Ricci soliton
configurations. Such solutions are defined by employing the general ansatz
encompassing coefficients of generic off-diagonal metrics and generalized
connections that depend generically on all spacetime coordinates. We consider
nonholonomic constraints resulting in diagonal homogeneous configurations
encoding contributions from possible nonlinear parametric geometric evolution
scenarios, off-diagonal interactions and anisotropic polarization/ modification
of physical constants. We also analyze the conditions under which such modified
mimetic type theories and solutions reproduce the Starobinsky inflationary
models in the double scalar approach.

From its origin as a gravitational wave, inflation in space is the force that propagates with a force of light. This mass of the observer at a given set of velocity is assumed to be perpendicular to the gravitational field. In this paper we show that these two general points of view do not cohere easily. So it is not only that there is an infinite potential force, but also that an exponential change in velocity accelerates to a non-linear distribution due to our laws of motion. We also show, for a very fast period of time, that inflation can be driven directly by a single force. For inflation to arise, however, we need to change our theory of gravity to understand its roots.

Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"  Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent
years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose
significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a
general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training
environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in
downstream tasks. Our approach brings together some of the strengths of
intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is
guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal
domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is
trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the
exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To
efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks
combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that
this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills
in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance
uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.

Light-Cone Coordinate System in General Relativity,"  If there is a null gradient field in 1+3 dimensional space-time, we can set
up a kind of light-cone coordinate system in the space-time. In such coordinate
system, the metric takes a simple form, which is much helpful for simplifying
and solving the Einstein's field equation. This light-cone coordinate system
has wonderful properties and has been widely used in astrophysics to calculate

"Iterative graph cuts for image segmentation with a nonlinear statistical
  shape prior","  Shape-based regularization has proven to be a useful method for delineating
objects within noisy images where one has prior knowledge of the shape of the
targeted object. When a collection of possible shapes is available, the
specification of a shape prior using kernel density estimation is a natural
technique. Unfortunately, energy functionals arising from kernel density
estimation are of a form that makes them impossible to directly minimize using
efficient optimization algorithms such as graph cuts. Our main contribution is
to show how one may recast the energy functional into a form that is
minimizable iteratively and efficiently using graph cuts.

Gradient Clock Synchronization using Reference Broadcasts,"  In this paper we suggest a method by which reference broadcast
synchronization (RBS), and other methods of estimating clock values, can be
incorporated in standard clock synchronization algorithms to improve
synchronization quality. We advocate a logical separation of the task of
estimating the clock values of other nodes in the network from the task of
using these estimates to output a logical clock value.
  The separation is achieved by means of a virtual estimate graph, overlaid on
top of the real network graph, which represents the information various nodes
can obtain about each other. RBS estimates are represented in the estimate
graph as edges between nodes at distance 2 from each other in the original
network graph. A clock synchronization algorithm then operates on the estimate
graph as though it were the original network.
  To illustrate the merits of this approach, we modify a recent optimal
gradient clock synchronization algorithm to work in this setting. The modified
algorithm transparently takes advantage of RBS estimates and any other means by
which nodes can estimate each others' clock values.

"Performance of the CMS Tracker Optical Links and Future Upgrade Using
  Bandwidth Efficient Digital Modulation","  (Abridged version) The CMS experiment at the LHC will begin operation in
2007. The CMS Tracker sub-detector, comprises ~10 million detector channels
read out by ~40 000 analog optical links. The optoelectronic components have
been designed to meet the stringent requirements of a HEP experiment in terms
of radiation hardness, low mass and low power. Extensive testing has been
performed on the components and on complete optical links in test systems.
Their functionality and performance in terms of gain, noise, linearity,
bandwidth and radiation hardness is detailed. Particular emphasis is placed on
the gain, which directly affects the dynamic range of the detector data. It has
been possible to accurately predict the variation in gain that will be observed
throughout the system. A simulation based on production test data showed that
the average gain would be ~38% higher than the design target at the Tracker
operating temperature of -10{\deg}C. Corrective action was taken to reduce the
gains and recover the lost dynamic range by lowering the optical receiver's
load resistor value from 100{\Omega} to 62{\Omega}. All links will have gains
between 0.64 and 0.96V/V. The future iteration of CMS will be operated in an
upgraded LHC requiring faster data readout. In order to preserve the large
investments made for the current readout system, an upgrade path that involves
reusing the existing optoelectronic components is considered. The applicability
of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in a HEP readout system is examined.
The method for calculating the data rate is presented, along with laboratory
tests where QAM signals were transmitted over a Tracker optical link. The
results show that 3-4Gbit/s would be possible if such a design can be
implemented (over 10 times the equivalent data rate of the current analog
links, 320Mbits/s).
","Performance of the CMS Tracker Optical Links and Future Upgrade Using
  Bandwidth Efficient Digital Modulation


The next steps in the development of a CMS tracking and the implementation of this technology will be to achieve the following: A) the incorporation into the design of each digital instrument, to create multiple channels to feed a single optical link; B) a fully automated approach in which multiple optical links can be fed through the system; and C) more efficient and more reliable digital modification for the data on a given system. For example, as of today, the detection range on the optical instrument is only one channel long and in practice one system may require two optical targets at the same time (depending on where a system is located during a measurement and what type of optical system the tracking system supports). By adding different optical systems into one device and increasing the time needed to detect all of them simultaneously, such tracking systems can generate multiple-component detectors that can perform up to a standard 3x optical measurement at just a few bits every 2s, while the number of integrated signal sources reduces. In this way, a faster time is created for data integration in real time.

Multifractality and scale invariance in human heartbeat dynamics,"  Human heart rate is known to display complex fluctuations. Evidence of
multifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported
[Ivanov et al., Nature {\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character
could be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability
density functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale
invariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart
rate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In
this paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance
reported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy
heartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating
that the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent.
Our work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of
human heartbeat dynamics, which is shared by heart rate fluctuations in both
healthy and pathological states.

Skyrmion Burst and Multiple Quantum Walk in Thin Ferromagnetic Films,"  A giant Skyrmion collapses to a singular point by emitting spin waves in a
thin ferromagnetic film, when external magnetic field is increased beyond the
critical one. The remnant is a single-spin flipped (SSF) point. The SSF point
has a quantum diffusion dynamics governed by the Heisenberg model. We determine
its time evolution and show the diffusion process is a continuous-time quantum
walk. We also analyze an interference of two SSF points after two Skyrmion
bursts. Quantum walks for $S=1/2$ and 1 are exact solvable. The system presents
a new type of quantum walk for $S>1/2$, where a SSF point breaks into 2S
quantum walkers. It is interesting that we can create quantum walkers
experimentally at any points in a magnetic thin film, first by creating
Skyrmions sequentially and then by letting them collapse simultaneously.

"3D Integral Field Observations of Ten Galactic Winds - I. Extended phase
  (>10 Myr) of mass/energy injection before the wind blows","  We present 3D spectroscopic observations of a sample of 10 nearby galaxies
with the AAOmega-SPIRAL integral field spectrograph on the 3.9m AAT, the
largest survey of its kind to date. The double-beam spectrograph provides
spatial maps in a range of spectral diagnostics: [OIII] 5007, H-beta, Mg-b,
NaD, [OI] 6300, H-alpha, [NII] 6583, [SII] 6717, 6731. All of the objects in
our survey show extensive wind-driven filamentation along the minor axis, in
addition to large-scale disk rotation. Our sample can be divided into either
starburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN), although some objects
appear to be a combination of these. The total ionizing photon budget available
to both classes of galaxies is sufficient to ionise all of the wind-blown
filamentation out to large radius. We find however that while AGN
photoionisation always dominates in the wind filaments, this is not the case in
starburst galaxies where shock ionisation dominates. This clearly indicates
that after the onset of star formation, there is a substantial delay (> 10 Myr)
before a starburst wind develops. We show why this behavior is expected by
deriving ``ionisation'' and dynamical timescales for both AGNs and starbursts.
We establish a sequence of events that lead to the onset of a galactic wind.
The clear signature provided by the ionisation timescale is arguably the
strongest evidence yet that the starburst phenomenon is an impulsive event. A
well-defined ionisation timescale is not expected in galaxies with a protracted
history of circumnuclear star formation. Our 3D data provide important
templates for comparisons with high redshift galaxies.[Abridged]

Adaptive optics in high-contrast imaging,"  The development of adaptive optics (AO) played a major role in modern
astronomy over the last three decades. By compensating for the atmospheric
turbulence, these systems enable to reach the diffraction limit on large
telescopes. In this review, we will focus on high contrast applications of
adaptive optics, namely, imaging the close vicinity of bright stellar objects
and revealing regions otherwise hidden within the turbulent halo of the
atmosphere to look for objects with a contrast ratio lower than 10^-4 with
respect to the central star. Such high-contrast AO-corrected observations have
led to fundamental results in our current understanding of planetary formation
and evolution as well as stellar evolution. AO systems equipped three
generations of instruments, from the first pioneering experiments in the
nineties, to the first wave of instruments on 8m-class telescopes in the years
2000, and finally to the extreme AO systems that have recently started
operations. Along with high-contrast techniques, AO enables to reveal the
circumstellar environment: massive protoplanetary disks featuring spiral arms,
gaps or other asymmetries hinting at on-going planet formation, young giant
planets shining in thermal emission, or tenuous debris disks and micron-sized
dust leftover from collisions in massive asteroid-belt analogs. After
introducing the science case and technical requirements, we will review the
architecture of standard and extreme AO systems, before presenting a few
selected science highlights obtained with recent AO instruments.

.2 Contrast range is the number of pixels (mm) that are present in the photo. That is, if there are no pixels present at the pixel (i.e., between points at which pixels are visible), the image will be seen as though pixel number 7 were not present.

Tools and Procedures for the CTA Array Calibration,"  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an international initiative to build
the next generation ground-based very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory. Full
sky coverage will be assured by two arrays, one located on each of the northern
and southern hemispheres. Three different sizes of telescopes will cover a wide
energy range from tens of GeV up to hundreds of TeV. These telescopes, of which
prototypes are currently under construction or completion, will have different
mirror sizes and fields-of-view designed to access different energy regimes.
Additionally, there will be groups of telescopes with different optics system,
camera and electronics design. Given this diversity of instruments, an overall
coherent calibration of the full array is a challenging task. Moreover, the CTA
requirements on calibration accuracy are much more stringent than those
achieved with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, like for
instance: the systematic errors in the energy scale must not exceed 10%.In this
contribution we present both the methods that, applied directly to the acquired
observational CTA data, will ensure that the calibration is correctly performed
to the stringent required precision, and the calibration equipment that,
external to the telescopes, is currently under development and testing.
Moreover, some notes about the operative procedure to be followed with both
methods and instruments, will be described. The methods applied to the
observational CTA data include the analysis of muon ring images, of carefully
selected cosmic-ray air shower images, of the reconstructed electron spectrum
and that of known gamma-ray sources and the possible use of stereo techniques
hardware-independent. These methods will be complemented with the use of
calibrated light sources located on ground or on board unmanned aerial
vehicles.

"Maximal intensity higher-order Akhmediev breathers of the nonlinear
  Schrodinger equation and their systematic generation","  It is well known that Akhmediev breathers of the nonlinear cubic Schrodinger
equation can be superposed nonlinearly via the Darboux transformation to yield
breathers of higher order. Surprisingly, we find that the peak height of each
Akhmediev breather only adds {\it linearly} to form the peak height of the
final breather. Using this new peak-height formula, we show that at any given
periodicity, there exist a unique high-order breather of maximal intensity.
Moreover, these high-order breathers form a continuous hierarchy, growing in
intensity with increasing periodicity. For any such higher-order breather, a
simple initial wave function can be extracted from the Darboux transformation
to dynamically generate that breather from the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

"Sizes of transition-region structures in coronal holes and in the quiet
  Sun","  We study the height variations of the sizes of chromospheric and
transition-region features in a small coronal hole and the adjacent quiet Sun,
considering images of the intensity, Doppler shift, and non-thermal motion of
ultraviolet emission lines as measured by SUMER, together with the magnetic
field as obtained by extrapolation from photospheric magnetograms. In order to
estimate the characteristic sizes of the different features present in the
chromosphere and transition region, we have calculated the autocorrelation
function for the images as well as the corresponding extrapolated magnetic
field at different heights. The HWHM of the autocorrelation function is
considered to be the characteristic size of the feature shown in the
corresponding image. Our results indicate that, in both the coronal hole and
quiet Sun, the HWHM of the intensity image is larger than that of the images of
Doppler-shift and non-thermal width at any given altitude. The HWHM of the
intensity image is smaller in the chromosphere than in the TR, where the sizes
of intensity features of lines at different temperatures are almost the same.
But in the upper part of the transition region, the intensity size increases
more strongly with temperature in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun. We
also studied the height variations of the HWHM of the magnetic field magnitude
B and its component |Bz|, and found they are equal to each other at a certain
height below 40 Mm in the coronal hole. The height variations of the HWHM of
|Bz/B| seem to be consistent with the temperature variations of the intensity
size. Our results suggest that coronal loops are much lower, and magnetic
structures expand through the upper TR and lower corona much more strongly with
height in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun.

"Entropy Flattening, Gas Clumping and Turbulence in Galaxy Clusters","  Several physical processes and formation events are expected in cluster
outskirts, a vast region up to now essentially not covered by observations. The
recent Suzaku (X-ray) and Planck (Sunayev-Zeldovich effect) observations out to
the virial radius have highlighted in these peripheral regions a rather sharp
decline of the intracluster gas temperature, an entropy flattening in contrast
with the theoretically expected power law increase, the break of the
hydrostatic equilibrium even in some relaxed clusters, a derived gas mass
fraction above the cosmic value measured from several CMB experiments, and a
total X-ray mass lower than the weak lensing mass determinations. Here we
present the analysis of four clusters (A1795, A2029, A2204 and A133) with the
SuperModel that includes a nonthermal pressure component due to turbulence to
sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium also in the cluster outskirts. In such way
we obtain a correct determination of the total X-ray mass and of the gas mass
fraction; this in turn allows to determine the level of the gas clumping that
can affect the shape of the entropy profiles reported by the Suzaku
observations. Our conclusion is that the role of the gas clumping is very
marginal and that the observed entropy flattening is due to the rapid decrement
of the temperature in the cluster outskirts caused by non gravitational
effects. Moreover, we show that the X-ray/SZ joint analysis from ROSAT and
Planck data, as performed in some recent investigations, is inadequate to
discriminate between a power law increase and a flattening of the entropy.

"The Vlasov model under large magnetic fields in the low-Mach number
  regime","  This article is concerned with the kinetic modeling, by means of the Vlasov
equation, of charged particles under the influence of a strong external
electromagnetic field, i.e. when epsilon^2, the dimensionless cyclotron period,
tends to zero. This leads us to split the velocity variable in the Vlasov
equation into fluid and random components. The latter is supposed to have a
large magnitude of order 1/epsilon (which corresponds to the low Mach number
regime). In the limit epsilon -> 0, the resulting model is a hybrid model which
couples a kinetic description of the microscopic random motion of the particles
to a fluid description of the macroscopic behavior of the plasma. The
microscopic model is a first-order partial differential system for the
distribution function, which is averaged over the ultra-fast Larmor gyration
and the fast parallel motion along the magnetic field lines. The perpendicular
component (with respect to the magnetic field lines) of the bulk velocity is
governed by the classical relations describing the E X B and diamagnetic
drifts, while its parallel component satisfies an elliptic equation along the
magnetic field lines.

Naive model from 1970th applied to CMR manganites: it seems to work,"  Existing experimental data for various colossal magnetoresistance manganites

by the strong Weiss exchange field that arises from the magnetic order in the
substance. The field--caused shifts of the conducting bands results in the
change in the number of thermally activated carriers, and this change is
presumed to be responsible for the resistivity dependences on temperature and
magnetic field and for the CMR itself. Employing this model we calculate this

"Faraday Rotation in Global Accretion Disk Simulations: Implications for
  Sgr A*","  These Faraday rotation calculations of hot, thick accretion flows are
motivated by the measured steady rotation measure (RM) of $\approx -6 \times
10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A*. In our numerical simulations, the quasi-steady
state structure of the accretion flow, and the RM it produces, depends on the
initial magnetic field. In spite of this dependence, we can draw several robust
conclusions about Faraday rotation produced by geometrically thick accretion
disks: i) the time averaged RM does not depend that sensitively on the viewing
angle, but the stability of the RM can. Equatorial viewing angles show
significant variability in RM (including sign reversals), while polar viewing
angles are relatively stable if there is a large scale magnetic field threading
the disk at large radii. ii) Most of the RM is produced at small radii for
polar viewing angles while all radii contribute significantly near the midplane
of the disk. Our simulations confirm previous analytic arguments that the
accretion rate onto Sgr A* must satisfy $\dot M_{\rm in} \ll \dot M_{\rm Bondi}
\sim 10^{-5} \mpy$ in order to not over-produce the measured RM. We argue that
the steady RM $\approx -6 \times 10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A* has two
plausible explanations: 1) it is produced at $\sim 100$ Schwarzschild radii,
requires $\dot{M}_{\rm in} \approx 3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and we
view the flow at an angle of $\sim 30^\circ$ relative to the rotation axis of
the disk; in our simulations, the variation in RM across a finite-sized source
is sufficient to depolarize the emission below $\approx$ 100 GHz, consistent
with observations. 2) Alternatively, the RM may be produced in the relatively
spherical inflowing plasma near the circularization radius at $\sim 10^3-10^4$
Schwarzschild radii.

 (see http://www.einstein.usgs.edu/publications/) Abstract The following work investigates the prediction of the acceleration of galactic mass in the general process of compact expansion using a 3-dimensional ""Granularity"" model. We show that, in our model of mass at 0.19±1.1 times the observed radius, the initial gravitational potential of a galaxy will be 2.6 times that of an Earth. Moreover, such a model predicts a large proportion of future expansion in a system within which it is not possible not to lose the expansion. The result suggests that the gravitational current is very strong in space, as is evidenced by the strong expansion over a distant galaxy, although with limited means for extrapolation. This study does not account for the very sharp slowdown in galaxy formation as the Earth collapses, which is considered to be a crucial factor in accelerating the rate of expansion of galaxies. However, a detailed analysis indicates that this small expansion rate is probably much harder to detect in an empty galaxy. Finally, this paper argues that these observations are too weak to warrant the use of models that predict large deviations in galactic gravitation, and instead rely strongly on the predictions of quantum mechanics and the weak gravitational motion of distant galaxies to generate their initial expansion rates",0.22485446256135194,0.17777777282620322,0.15337423312883433

From Hopf fibrations to exotic causal replacements,"  Topological solitons are relevant in several areas of physics [1]. Recently,
these configurations have been investigated in contexts as diverse as
hydrodynamics [2], Bose-Einstein condensates [3], ferromagnetism [4], knotted
light [5] and non-abelian gauge theories [6]. In this paper we address the
issue of wave propagation about a static Hopf soliton in the context of the
Nicole model. Working within the geometrical optics limit we show that several
nontrivial lensing effects emerge due to nonlinear interactions as long as the
theory remains hyperbolic. We conclude that similar effects are very likely to
occur in effective field theories characterized by a topological invariant such
as the Skyrme model of pions.

Magnetic Skyrmions for Cache Memory,"  Magnetic skyrmions (MS) are particle-like spin structures with whirling
configuration, which are promising candidates for spin-based memory. MS
contains alluring features including remarkably high stability, ultra low
driving current density, and compact size. Due to their higher stability and
lower drive current requirement for movement, skyrmions have great potential in
energy efficient spintronic device applications. We propose a skyrmion-based
cache memory where data can be stored in a long nanotrack as multiple bits.
Write operation (formation of skyrmion) can be achieved by injecting spin
polarized current in a magnetic nanotrack and subsequently shifting the MS in
either direction along the nanotrack using charge current through a spin-Hall
metal (SHM), underneath the magnetic layer. The presence of skyrmion can alter
the resistance of a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) at the read port.
Considering the read and write latency along the long nanotrack cache memory, a
strategy of multiple read and write operations is discussed. Besides, the size
of a skyrmion affects the packing density, current induced motion velocity, and
readability (change of resistance while sensing the existence of a skyrmion).
Design optimization to mitigate the above effects is also investigated.

Discrete intrinsic localized modes in a microelectromechanical resonator,"  Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILMs) or Discrete Breathers (DBs) are produced
through a non-linear vibration localization phenomenon. While Anderson
localization is due to lattice defects, the nonlinearity of lattices provides
the basis for ILM excitation. Over the past two decades, these ILMs have been
realized in a wide range of physical systems including photonic crystals,
nonlinear atomic lattices, anti-ferromagnets, coupled Josephson junction arrays
and coupled cantilevers. This paper brings out the feasibility of exciting ILMs
in a standalone mechanical resonator. Through piezoelectric driving and optical
visualization, various intriguing features of ILMs have been recorded. The ILMs
in our system are observed as spectral bushes and their frequencies are much
lower than that of the drive frequency. The excitation of ILMs is mediated
through large amplitude instability following autoparametric excitation of a
sub-harmonic mode. The spatial prevalence of discrete ILM excitations is at
antinodes of the sub-harmonic mode. Further, the ILMs have been observed to be
time-variant and various events including attraction-repulsion (or
splitting-merging) of ILMs and hopping occur during the time evolution of ILMs.
","Discrete intrinsic localized modes in a microelectromechanical resonator can be observed by observing the waveforms of the beam pulses, the phase transitions from the oscillator to the resonant phase, and the angular momentum of a corresponding output device at the desired voltage. To be an electron to electron electron wave, two of its three phases must be simultaneously excited: the active and a neutral wave (for a more complete view use the corresponding illustration in section 4.10). At this voltage, excitation of two wave cavities or two electrodes is necessary to achieve two states of polarization: if the electrons are excited simultaneously, each resonated in turn, they will produce two electrons at opposite polarity of positive and negative polivers; if both were excited in opposite directions, all two poliver resonations will be in the same state at a different politt",0.19750158944823565,0.14953270534326157,0.1776022335734832
"Theoretical description of heavy impurity transport and its application
  to the modelling of tungsten in JET and ASDEX Upgrade","  Recent developments in theory-based modelling of core heavy impurity
transport are presented, and shown to be necessary for quantitative description
of present experiments in JET and ASDEX Upgrade. The treatment of heavy
impurities is complicated by their large mass and charge, which result in a
strong response to plasma rotation or any small background electrostatic field
in the plasma, such as that generated by anisotropic external heating. These
forces lead to strong poloidal asymmetries of impurity density, which have
recently been added to numerical tools describing both neoclassical and
turbulent transport. Modelling predictions of the steady-state two-dimensional
tungsten impurity distribution are compared with experimental densities
interpreted from soft X-ray diagnostics. The modelling identifies neoclassical
transport enhanced by poloidal asymmetries as the dominant mechanism
responsible for tungsten accumulation in the central core of the plasma.
Depending on the bulk plasma profiles, neoclassical temperature screening can
prevent accumulation, and can be enhanced by externally heated species,
demonstrated here in ICRH plasmas.

Hadrons in the Nuclear Medium,"  Nucleon properties are modified in the nuclear medium. To understand these
modifications and their origin is a central issue in nuclear physics. For
example, a wide variety of QCD-based models, including quark-meson coupling and
chiral-quark soliton models, predict that the nuclear constituents change
properties with increasing density. These changes are predicted to lead to
observable changes in the nucleon structure functions and electromagnetic form
factors.
  We present results from a series of recent experiments at MAMI and Jefferson

to test these predictions. These results, with the most precise data at Q^2 =
0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and at 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 from E03-104, put strong constraints on
available model calculations, such that below Q^2 = 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 the measured
ratios of polarization-transfer are successfully described in a fully
relativistic calculation when including a medium modification of the proton
form factors or, alternatively, by strong charge-exchange final-state
interactions. We also discuss possible extensions of these studies with

self-diffraction of optical waves in a nonlinear cavity. The case of the
reflection geometry of wave interaction as well as a medium that possesses the
cubic nonlinearity (including a local and a nonlocal nonlinear responses) and
the relaxation is considered. A stable localized spatial structure in the form
of a ""dark"" dissipative soliton is formed in the cavity in the steady state.
The envelope of the intensity pattern, as well as of the dynamical grating
amplitude, takes the shape of a $\tanh$ function. The obtained complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation describes the dynamics of this envelope, at the same
time the evolution of this spatial structure changes the parameters of the
output waves. New effects are predicted in this system due to the
transformation of the dissipative soliton which takes place during the
interaction of a pulse with a continuous wave, such as: retention of the pulse
shape during the transmission of impulses in a long nonlinear cavity; giant
amplification of a seed pulse, which takes energy due to redistribution of the

"Variable-delay feedback control of unstable steady states in retarded
  time-delayed systems","  We study the stability of unstable steady states in scalar retarded
time-delayed systems subjected to a variable-delay feedback control. The
important aspect of such a control problem is that time-delayed systems are
already infinite-dimensional before the delayed feedback control is turned on.
When the frequency of the modulation is large compared to the system's
dynamics, the analytic approach consists of relating the stability properties
of the resulting variable-delay system with those of an analogous distributed
delay system. Otherwise, the stability domains are obtained by a numerical
integration of the linearized variable-delay system. The analysis shows that
the control domains are significantly larger than those in the usual
time-delayed feedback control, and that the complexity of the domain structure
depends on the form and the frequency of the delay modulation.

"Estimating the parameters of globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099) from
  time-series photometry","  We present the analysis of 26 nights of V and I time-series observations from
2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099). We used our data to
search for variable stars in this cluster and refine the periods of known
variables; we then used our variable star light curves to derive values for the
cluster's parameters. We used difference image analysis to reduce our data to
obtain high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the
cluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light curves of
RR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible. We also derive an
estimate for the age of the cluster by fitting theoretical isochrones to our
colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as
variables, we find that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR
Lyrae variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the
literature. We also detect four other new variables, including an eclipsing
blue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts to a total number
of confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform Fourier decomposition of
the light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to derive cluster parameters using
empirical relations. We find a cluster metallicity [Fe/H]_ZW=-2.01 +- 0.04, or
[Fe/H]_UVES=-2.11 +- 0.06, and a distance of 8.32 +- 0.20 kpc (using RR0
variables), 8.10 kpc (using one RR1 variable), and 8.35 +- 0.42 kpc (using our

Cooperative Learning with Visual Attributes,"  Learning paradigms involving varying levels of supervision have received a
lot of interest within the computer vision and machine learning communities.
The supervisory information is typically considered to come from a human
supervisor -- a ""teacher"" figure. In this paper, we consider an alternate
source of supervision -- a ""peer"" -- i.e. a different machine. We introduce
cooperative learning, where two agents trying to learn the same visual
concepts, but in potentially different environments using different sources of
data (sensors), communicate their current knowledge of these concepts to each
other. Given the distinct sources of data in both agents, the mode of
communication between the two agents is not obvious. We propose the use of
visual attributes -- semantic mid-level visual properties such as furry,
wooden, etc.-- as the mode of communication between the agents. Our experiments
in three domains -- objects, scenes, and animals -- demonstrate that our
proposed cooperative learning approach improves the performance of both agents
as compared to their performance if they were to learn in isolation. Our
approach is particularly applicable in scenarios where privacy, security and/or
bandwidth constraints restrict the amount and type of information the two
agents can exchange.

in connection with a protocol for controlling large networks of spin 1/2
quantum mechanical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 100501 (2007)]. A
description is as follows: each vertex of an initially selected set has a
packet of information (the same for every element of the set), which will be
distributed among vertices of the graph; a vertex v can pass its packet to an
adjacent vertex w only if w is its only neighbour without the information. By
mean of examples, we describe some general properties, mainly concerning
homeomorphism, and redundant edges. We prove that the cardinality of the

"The role of stellar relaxation in the formation and evolution of the
  first massive black holes","  We present calculations on the formation of massive black holes with 10^5
Msun at z > 6 that can be the seeds of supermassive black holes at z > 6. Under
the assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging galaxies, star
clusters in haloes of 10^8 ~ 10^9 Msun can undergo rapid core-collapse leading
to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) with ~1000 Msun which directly
collapse into black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in halos of > 10^9
Msun experience type-II supernovae before the formation of VMSs due to long
core-collapse time scales. We also model the subsequent growth of black holes
via accretion of residual stars in clusters. 2-body relaxation efficiently
re-fills the loss cones of stellar orbits at larger radii and resonant
relaxation at small radii is the main driver for accretion of stars onto black
holes. As a result, more than ninety percent of stars in the initial cluster
are swallowed by the central black holes before z=6. Using dark matter merger
trees we derive black hole mass functions at z=6-20. The mass function ranges
from 10^3 to 10^5 Msun at z <~ 15. Major merging of galaxies of >~ 4*10^8 Msun
at z ~ 20 successfully leads to the formation of >~ 10^5 Msun BHs by z >~ 10
which can be the potential seeds of supermassive black holes seen today.
","The role of stellar relaxation in the formation and evolution of the
  first massive black holes began with the discovery of a black hole, an asteroid. At this time the most distant star-forming star was a dwarf, the Alpha Centauri B. This newfound star had about 1,800 million years of star formation, but was the first black ""supermassive black"" star to be found outside the Big Bang. As the gravitational pull from all known black objects in our galaxy and beyond slowly weakened the mass of its central core, it was almost out of reach for most stars as the gas had to get absorbed into the atmosphere and it started to expand faster than they had already been ejected. Then the gravity of this neutron star began to increase so rapidly that we now see a mass ratio of about 3:2 (and if you consider the total number of stars from the same galaxy, you should see about 9.8 times that!) for the __________ star.

To make matters worse, black dwarfs are very small in their mass and their distance from our Sun are about the radius of our planet. And that means that if the",0.2675347292994718,0.21011672651819116,0.18192968111201963

Simulation of quasi-stationary distributions on countable spaces,"  Quasi-stationary distributions (QSD) have been widely studied since the
pioneering work of Kolmogorov (1938), Yaglom (1947) and Sevastyanov (1951).
They appear as a natural object when considering Markov processes that are
certainly absorbed since they are invariant for the evolution of the
distribution of the process conditioned on not being absorbed. They hence
appropriately describe the state of the process at large times for non absorbed
paths. Unlike invariant distributions for Markov processes, QSD are solutions
of a non-linear equation and there can be 0, 1 or an infinity of them. Also,
they cannot be obtained as Ces\`aro limits of Markovian dynamics. These facts
make the computation of QSDs a nontrivial matter. We review different
approximation methods for QSD that are useful for simulation purposes, mainly
focused on Fleming-Viot dynamics. We also give some alternative proofs and
extensions of known results.
","Simulation of quasi-stationary distributions on countable spaces at both the scale and by the metric (see Supplementary Table 1). At the scaling point, the proportion of objects of any type represented in this volume cannot be increased. It makes it easy to determine how many of the nonmonoidal configurations at any time point and this gives a general idea of where to store the distribution.

"Size fluctuations of the initial source and the event-by-event
  transverse momentum fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions","  We show that the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse size of the
initial source, which follow directly from the Glauber treatment of the
earliest stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, cause, after hydrodynamic
evolution, fluctuations of the transverse flow velocity at hadronic freeze-out.
This in turn leads to event-by-event fluctuations of the average transverse
momentum, p_T. Simulations with GLISSANDO for the Glauber phase, followed by a
realistic hydrodynamic evolution and statistical hadronization carried out with
THERMINATOR, lead to agreement with the RHIC data. In particular, the magnitude
of the effect, its centrality dependence, and the weak dependence on the
incident energy are properly reproduced. Our results show that bulk of the

Boson-sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure,"  Boson-sampling has attracted much interest as a simplified approach to
implementing a subset of optical quantum computing. Boson-sampling requires
indistinguishable photons, but far fewer of them than universal optical quantum
computing architectures. In reality, photons are never indistinguishable, and
exhibit a rich spectral structure. Here we consider the operation of
boson-sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure and relate the
sampling statistics of the device to matrix permanents. This sheds light on the
computational complexity of different regimes of the photons' spectral
characteristics, and provides very general results for the operation of linear
optics interferometers in the presence of partially distinguishable photons.

"Evolution of Scientific Collaboration Network Driven by Homophily and
  Heterophily","  Many scientific collaboration networks exhibit clear community and small
world structures. However, the studies on the underlying mechanisms for the
formation and evolution of community and small world structures are still
insufficient. The mechanisms of homophily and heterophily based on scholars'
traits are two important factors for the formation of community and
inter-communal links, which may deserve further exploration. In this paper, a
multi-agent model, which is based on combinatorial effects of homophily and
heterophily, is developed to investigate the evolution of scientific
collaboration networks. The simulation results indicate that agents with
similar traits aggregate to form community by homophily, while heterophily
plays a major role in the formation of inter-communal links. The pattern of
network evolution revealed in simulations is essentially consistent with what
is observed in empirical analyses, as in both cases the giant component evolves
from a small cluster to a structure of chained-communities, and then to a small
world network with community structure. This work may provides an alternative
view on the underlying mechanisms for the formation of community and small
world structures, complementary to the mainstream view that the small-world is
generated from the combination of the structural embeddedness and structural
holes mechanisms.

Abstract: The relationship of group genetic and epigenetic inheritance to disease progression is well documented in multiple published studies. Indeed, there are compelling long-term implications of genomic heterogeneity among different populations in the context of many aspects of disease. We summarize an extensive literature review of the literature on the relation between evolutionary selection and molecular variation and explore the theoretical and empirical questions surrounding the potential for genomic stratification through evolutionary adaptation, which in turn may enable the identification of molecular targets that, while important in diseases, cannot be easily applied in other populations. The goal of this paper is to provide an account of how genomic and genotypic heterogeneity within populations has led to epigenetics and the emergence of a genetic stratigraphic continuum that has influenced disease development (Cummarized",0.23332776693465096,0.14814814314857697,0.20190156895967687
Scaling Relations Between Low-mass Black Holes and Their Host Galaxies,"  It is well established that supermassive black holes in nearby elliptical
galaxies correlate tightly with the kinematic property ($\mbhsigma$
correlation) and stellar mass ($\mbhhost$ correlation) of their host spheroids.
However, it is not clear what the relations would be at the low-mass end, and
how they evolve. Here, we investigate these relations in low-mass systems
($\MBH \sim \rm{10^{6}- 10^{8}}\, \Msun$) using the Aquila Simulation, a
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation which follows the
formation and evolution of stars and black holes in a Milky Way-size galaxy and
its substructures. We find a number of interesting results on the origin and
evolution of the scaling relations in these systems: (1) there is a strong
redshift evolution in the $\mbhsigma$ relation, but a much weaker one in the
$\mbhhost$ relation; (2) there is a close link between the $\mbhsigma$ relation
and the dynamical state of the system -- the galaxies that fall on the observed
correlation appear to have reached virial equilibrium. (3) the star formation
and black hole growth are self-regulated in galaxies -- the ratio between black
hole accretion rate and star formation rate remains nearly constant in a wide
redshift span $z = 0-6$. These findings suggest that the observed correlations
have different origins: the $\mbhsigma$ relation may be the result of virial
equilibrium, while the $\mbhhost$ relation may the result of self-regulated
star formation and black hole growth in galaxies.

Fixed point theorems in plane continua with applications,"  We present proofs of basic results, including those developed by Harold Bell,
for the plane fixed point problem: does every map of a non-separating plane
continuum have a fixed point? Some of these results had been announced much
earlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the
variation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the
map on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively
oriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results
announced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line
which sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We
generalize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively
oriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These
methods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are
degenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a
special case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant
subcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer
points and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a
point. It follows that impressions of some external rays to polynomial Julia
sets are degenerate.

Network Topology Identification from Spectral Templates,"  Network topology inference is a cornerstone problem in statistical analyses
of complex systems. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates
benefits from convex optimization and graph signal processing, to identify the
so-termed graph shift operator (encoding the network topology) given only the
eigenvectors of the shift. These spectral templates can be obtained, for
example, from principal component analysis of a set of graph signals defined on
the particular network. The novel idea is to find a graph shift that while
being consistent with the provided spectral information, it endows the network
structure with certain desired properties such as sparsity. The focus is on
developing efficient recovery algorithms along with identifiability conditions
for two particular shifts, the adjacency matrix and the normalized graph
Laplacian. Application domains include network topology identification from
steady-state signals generated by a diffusion process, and design of a graph
filter that facilitates the distributed implementation of a prescribed linear
network operator. Numerical tests showcase the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms in recovering synthetic and structural brain networks.

curvature and deviations from general relativity using the growth-index

better than 6\% when we also allow for a spatially-curved Universe.

Ideal magnetic dipole scattering,"  We introduce the concept of tunable ideal magnetic dipole scattering, where a

refractive index subwavelength nanoparticles usually support both electric and

one has to suppress the electric dipole response. Such a possibility was
recently demonstrated for the so-called anapole mode, which is associated with
zero electric dipole scattering. By overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with
the anapole mode we achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering in the far-field
with tunable high scattering resonances in near infrared spectrum. We
demonstrate that such condition can be realized for two subwavelength
geometries. One of them is core-shell nanosphere consisting of Au core and
silicon shell. It can be also achieved in other geometries, including
nanodisks, which are compatible with current nanofabrication technology.

"Prediction of residue-residue contacts from protein families using

sample covariance matrix allows the computation of partial correlations between
pairs of residues, thereby removing the effect of spurious transitive
correlations. The method also accounts for low number of observations by means
of a regularization parameter that depends on the effective number of sequences
in the alignment. When tested on a set of protein families from Pfam, we found
the RLS algorithm to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods
for contact prediction, while at the same time being faster and conceptually
simpler.

Difficulty of distinguishing product states locally,"  Non-locality without entanglement is a rather counter-intuitive phenomenon in
which information may be encoded entirely in product (unentangled) states of
composite quantum systems in such a way that local measurement of the
subsystems is not enough for optimal decoding. For simple examples of pure
product states, the gap in performance is known to be rather small when
arbitrary local strategies are allowed. Here we restrict to local strategies
readily achievable with current technology; those requiring neither a quantum
memory nor joint operations. We show that, even for measurements on pure
product states there can be a large gap between such strategies and
theoretically optimal performance. Thus even in the absence of entanglement
physically realizable local strategies can be far from optimal for extracting
quantum information.
","Difficulty of distinguishing product states locally is probably different from our own in that an effort to determine such a thing, in other words, requires the analysis of other data sets. The only known measurement to measure a quality product is to look closely at the data, perhaps by using a machine. With that, the same thing might seem plausible for different categories of products. For example, if the product has a high degree of consumer satisfaction, then the quality rating may reflect satisfaction with the purchase of a particular brand of the particular product. Alternatively, a product can have higher than average quality, but may have just a mild, slight",0.2541271810104612,0.18292682427126722,0.1568334578043316

"In Quantum Computing Speedup Illusory?: The False Coin of ""Counting
  Function Evaluations""","  By using a new way to encode Boolean functions in a reversible gate, an
algorithm is developed in quantum computing over Z_2, symbolized QC/2, (as
opposed to QC over C) that needs only one function evaluation to solve the
Grover Database Search Problem of finding a designated record among 2^m records
for any m. In the usual Grover algorithm in quantum computing over C, one needs
essentially Sqrt(2^m) function evaluations as opposed to the average of (2^m)/2
functions evaluations needed in the classical algorithm. The one function
evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm (for any m) represents such a super speedup,
even over the Grover algorithm in QC/C, that one feels something has gone awry.
Indeed, our analysis of the transparent calculations of Boolean functions over
Z_2 shows that the classical algorithm is just repackaged in a rather obvious
way in the single function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm--whereas the
calculations are hidden and non-transparent in the Grover QC/C algorithm using
C. The conclusion in both cases (which is rather obvious in the QC/2 case) is
that ""counting function evaluations"" is a false coin to measure speedup in the
comparison between quantum and classical computing.

"BEER analysis of Kepler and CoRoT light curves: discovering binaries and
  exoplanets","  This thesis consists of seven scientific papers that cover the
proof-of-concept, the development, and discoveries made through the use of the
BEER (BEaming, Ellipsoidal, and Reflection) algorithm for searching for
companions in the light curves from the Kepler and CoRoT space telescopes.
  Paper I presents the detection of the ellipsoidal and the beaming effects in
the CoRoT light curve of CoRoT-3, a system of a $22$$M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarf
orbiting an F star with an orbital period of $4.3$ days. This work served as a
proof-of-concept that these effects are detectable in the space light curves of
systems with brown-dwarf or planetary secondaries, thus indicating that similar
modulations may be detected in the light curves of non-transiting systems.
  Abridged...
  The last study, Paper VII, demonstrates the different strengths and utility
of the BEER search algorithm. It presents the discovery of four short-period
eclipsing binaries in the Kepler light curves, consisting of an A-star primary
and a low-mass WD secondary (dA+WD). The systems show BEER phase modulations
together with primary and secondary eclipses. These add to the 6 Kepler, and 18
WASP, previously known short-period eclipsing dA+WD binaries. The paper shows
that three of the new systems harbor the smallest WDs detected so far in such
binaries. These three binaries extend the previously known population to older
systems with cooler and smaller WD secondaries, allowing to test binary
evolution theories in a parameter region not observed before.
  The seven papers illustrate the effectiveness of the BEER algorithm in
finding both common stellar binaries and rare astrophysical objects. As such,
the BEER tool can serve as an important component in the virtual astronomy
toolbox for mining the vast astronomical data produced by current and future
photometric surveys. Abridged.

of implementations are conducted, centralized and decentralized respectively.
In both implementations, unified API has been designed to guarantee the

designed to ease the burden of the centra thread at runtime. To evaluate the
mechanism, the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) are used to test the performance

Cloud Network Management Model A Novel Approach to Manage Cloud Traffic,"  Cloud is in the air. More and More companies and personals are connecting to
cloud with so many variety of offering provided by the companies. The cloud
services are based on Internet i.e. TCP IP. The paper discusses limitations of
one of the main existing network management protocol i.e. Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The
network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked
environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the
traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the
network condition. The proposed Model Cloud Network Management Model provides a
comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to
improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional TCP IP
network management protocol). Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet
exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems
exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the
manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized
technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure
packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to
manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a
theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The
model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and
protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported
algorithms.

"Disc truncation in embedded star clusters: Dynamical encounters versus
  face-on accretion","  Observations indicate that the dispersal of protoplanetary discs in star
clusters occurs on time scales of about 5 Myr. Several processes are thought to
be responsible for this disc dispersal. Here we compare two of these processes:
dynamical encounters and interaction with the interstellar medium, which
includes face-on accretion and ram pressure stripping. We perform simulations
of embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to
determine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant. We
find that face-on accretion, including ram pressure stripping, is the dominant
disc truncation process if the fraction of the total cluster mass in stars is
$\lesssim 30\,\%$ regardless of the cluster mass and radius. Dynamical
encounters require stellar densities $\gtrsim 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$ combined with a
mass fraction in stars of $\approx 90\,\%$ to become the dominant process. Our
results show that during the embedded phase of the cluster, the truncation of
the discs is dominated by face-on accretion and dynamical encounters become
dominant when the intra-cluster gas has been expelled. As a result of face-on
accretion the protoplanetary discs become compact and their surface density
increases. In contrast, dynamical encounters lead to discs that are less
massive and remain larger.

Analytic Reflected Lightcurves for Exoplanets,"  The disk-integrated reflected brightness of an exoplanet changes as a
function of time due to orbital and rotational motion coupled with an
inhomogeneous albedo map. We have previously derived analytic reflected
lightcurves for spherical harmonic albedo maps in the special case of a
synchronously-rotating planet on an edge-on orbit (Cowan, Fuentes & Haggard
2013). In this paper, we present analytic reflected lightcurves for the general
case of a planet on an inclined orbit, with arbitrary spin period and non-zero
obliquity. We do so for two different albedo basis maps: bright points
($\delta$-maps), and spherical harmonics ($Y_l^m$-maps). In particular, we use
Wigner $D$-matrices to express an harmonic lightcurve for an arbitrary viewing
geometry as a non-linear combination of harmonic lightcurves for the simpler
edge-on, synchronously rotating geometry. These solutions will enable future
exploration of the degeneracies and information content of reflected
lightcurves, as well as fast calculation of lightcurves for mapping exoplanets
based on time-resolved photometry. To these ends we make available Exoplanet
Analytic Reflected Lightcurves (EARL), a simple open-source code that allows
rapid computation of reflected lightcurves.

On the Hidden Maxwell Superalgebra underlying D=4 Supergravity,"  In this work, we expand the hidden $AdS$-Lorentz superalgebra underlying
$D=4$ supergravity, reaching a (hidden) Maxwell superalgebra. The latter can be
viewed as an extension involving cosmological constant of the superalgebra
underlying $D=4$ supergravity in flat spacetime. We write the Maurer-Cartan
equations in this context and we find some interesting extensions of the
antisymmetric $3$-form $A^{(3)}$ appearing in the Free Differential Algebra in
Minkowski space. The structure of Free Differential Algebras is obtained by
considering the zero curvature equations. We write the parametrization of
$A^{(3)}$ in terms of $1$-forms and we rend the topological features of its
extensions manifest. We interestingly find out that the structure of these
extensions, and consequently the structure of the corresponding boundary
contribution $dA^{(3)}$, strongly depends on the form of the extra fermionic
generator appearing in the hidden Maxwell superalgebra. The model we develop in
this work is defined in an enlarged superspace with respect to the ordinary
one, and the extra bosonic and fermionic $1$-forms required for the closure of
the hidden Maxwell superalgebra must be considered as physical fields in this
enlarged superspace.

Regular and Biregular module algebras,"  Motivated by the study of von Neumann regular skew groups as carried out by
Alfaro, Ara and del Rio in 1995 we investigate regular and biregular Hopf
module algebras. If $A$ is an algebra with an action by an affine Hopf algebra
$H$, then any $H$-stable left ideal of $A$ is a direct summand if and only if
$A^H$ is regular and the invariance functor $(-)^H$ induces an equivalence of
$A^H$-Mod to the Wisbauer category of $A$ as $A# H$-module. Analogously we show
a similar statement for the biregularity of $A$ relative to $H$ where $A^H$ is
replaced by $R=Z(A)\cap A^H$ using the module theory of $A$ as a module over
$A\otimes A^{op} \bowtie H$ the envelopping Hopf algebroid of $A$ and $H$. We
show that every two-sided $H$-stable ideal of $A$ is generated by a central
$H$-invariant idempotent if and only if $R$ is regular and $A_m$ is $H$-simple
for all maximal ideals $m$ of $R$. Further sufficient conditions are given for
$A# H$ and $A^H$ to be regular.

  Twitter Data for Population Health","  The utility of Twitter data as a medium to support population-level mental
health monitoring is not well understood. In an effort to better understand the
predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence
of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a
large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first
experiment, we assessed the contribution of feature groups such as lexical
information (e.g., unigrams) and emotions (e.g., strongly negative) using a
feature ablation study. In the second experiment, we determined the percentile
of top ranked features that produced the optimal classification performance by
applying a three-step feature elimination approach. In the first experiment, we
observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive
symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep
(-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score
performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across
classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to
depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no
consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets. We
conclude that simple lexical features and reduced feature sets can produce
comparable results to larger feature sets.

"Inferring the mesoscale structure of layered, edge-valued and
  time-varying networks","  Many network systems are composed of interdependent but distinct types of
interactions, which cannot be fully understood in isolation. These different
types of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges
or as a time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for
a more comprehensive scientific understanding, these representations offer
substantial challenges. Namely, it is an open problem how to precisely
characterize the large or mesoscale structure of network systems in relation to
these additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of these
features invariably increases the effective dimension of the network
description, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the use of
overly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations for
actual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to
tackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network
structure, incorporating layered, attributed and time-varying properties, as
well as a nonparametric Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data
and select the most appropriate model according to statistical evidence. We
show that the method is capable of revealing hidden structure in layered,
edge-valued and time-varying networks, and that the most appropriate level of
granularity with respect to the additional dimensions can be reliably
identified. We illustrate our approach on a variety of empirical systems,
including a social network of physicians, the voting correlations of deputies
in the Brazilian national congress, the global airport network, and a proximity
network of high-school students.

"Observing interferences between past and future quantum states in
  resonance fluorescence","  In quantum physics, measurement results are random but their statistics can
be predicted assuming some knowledge about the system in the past. Additional
knowledge from a future measurement deeply changes the statistics in the
present and leads to purely quantum features. In particular conditioned average
outcomes of a weak measurement, so-called weak values, were shown to go beyond
the conventional range, give a way to directly measure complex quantities, and
can be used to enhance the sensitivity of quantum meters. Recently, these
concepts have been considered in the general case of open quantum systems where
decoherence occurs. Then, what are the properties of weak values for the
unavoidable measurement associated to decoherence, the one performed by the
environment? Here, we answer this question in the simplest open quantum system:
a quantum bit in presence of a relaxation channel. We continuously monitor the
fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit driven at resonance.
Conditioned on initial preparation and final single shot measurement outcome of
the qubit state, we probe weak values displaying all the above properties. The
fluorescence signal exhibits interferences between oscillations associated to
past and future quantum states. The measured data are in complete agreement

environments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observations
of galaxy formation at high redshift. The next decade brings the observational
opportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formation
and assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority of
the stellar mass in the Universe but have until now been difficult to study. In
order to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal ""red-sequence"",
various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly with
resolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, can
be scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation is
increasingly available. At the same time, progress in adaptive optics on giant
telescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric and
spectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,
thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. Strong theoretical support is needed in
order to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling and

time.

"Correlation effects and collective excitations in bosonic bilayers: role
  of quantum statistics, superfluidity and dimerization transition","  A two-component two-dimensional (2D) dipolar bosonic system in the bilayer
geometry is considered. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a wide
range of layer spacings we analyze in detail the pair correlation functions,
the static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing
the layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer
states. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,
suppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation
spectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\em
in-phase} (symmetric) and {\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,
during the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic
reconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode
spectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer
superfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\gamma_s=\rho_s/\rho$). In
a pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is
recovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously,
and the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a
superfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly
with $\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\gamma_s$ is
reduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the
interlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by
static and dynamic properties.

"Interplay of insurance and financial risks in a discrete-time model with
  strongly regular variation","  Consider an insurance company exposed to a stochastic economic environment
that contains two kinds of risk. The first kind is the insurance risk caused by
traditional insurance claims, and the second kind is the financial risk
resulting from investments. Its wealth process is described in a standard
discrete-time model in which, during each period, the insurance risk is
quantified as a real-valued random variable $X$ equal to the total amount of
claims less premiums, and the financial risk as a positive random variable $Y$
equal to the reciprocal of the stochastic accumulation factor. This risk model
builds an efficient platform for investigating the interplay of the two kinds
of risk. We focus on the ruin probability and the tail probability of the
aggregate risk amount. Assuming that every convex combination of the
distributions of $X$ and $Y$ is of strongly regular variation, we derive some
precise asymptotic formulas for these probabilities with both finite and
infinite time horizons, all in the form of linear combinations of the tail
probabilities of $X$ and $Y$. Our treatment is unified in the sense that no
dominating relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is required.

"Efficiency Limits of Solar Energy Harvesting via Internal Photoemission
  in Carbon Materials","  We describe strategies to estimate the upper limits of the efficiency of
photon energy harvesting via hot electron extraction from gapless absorbers.
Gapless materials such as noble metals can be used for harvesting the whole
solar spectrum, including visible and near-infrared light. The energy of
photo-generated non-equilibrium or hot charge carriers can be harvested before
they thermalize with the crystal lattice via the process of their internal
photo-emission (IPE) through the rectifying Schottky junction with a
semiconductor. However, the low efficiency and the high cost of noble metals
necessitates the search for cheaper abundant alternative materials, and we show
here that carbon can serve as a promising IPE material candidate. We compare
the upper limits of performance of IPE photon energy-harvesting platforms,
which incorporate either gold or carbon as the photoactive material where hot
electrons are generated. Through a combination of density functional theory,
joint electron density of states calculations, and Schottky diode efficiency
modeling, we show that the material electron band structure imposes a strict
upper limit on the achievable efficiency of the IPE devices. Our calculations
reveal that graphite is a good material candidate for the IPE absorber for
harvesting visible and near-infrared photons. Graphite electron density of
states yields a sizeable population of hot electrons with energies high enough
to be collected across the potential barrier. We also discuss the mechanisms
that prevent the IPE device efficiency from reaching the upper limits imposed
by their material electron band structures. The proposed approach is general
and allows for efficient pre-screening of materials for their potential use in
IPE energy converters and photodetectors within application-specific spectral
windows.

losses, a ball of gas will undergo rapid cooling or stabilization by electron
degeneracy pressure before it can form a stable, nuclear reaction-sustaining

"Higher Order Elastic Instabilities of Metals: From Atom to Continuum
  Level","  Strain-based theory on elastic instabilities is being widely employed for
studying onset of plasticity, phase transition or melting in crystals. And size
effects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs to
account for contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient
based higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well
established to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids
directly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher
order elastic instabilities is established and justified by developing an
equivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical
instability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is
determined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain
gradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the
higher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be
directly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of
the stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals,
i.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression
technique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed
to study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted
critical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with the results from the
NEMD simulations for all the metals. Since the only inputs for the established
higher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations, i.e., atomic
potentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely
equivalent to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least,
for crystals.
","Higher Order Elastic Instabilities of Metals: From Atom to Continuum
  Level of Elasticity in Molecules: from Standard To Maximum Elasticness
, and an open question is whether a fundamental principle of molecular biology exists. A common way to look at this is to compare molecules with other forms of molecules. In the current literature, molecular biologists refer to molecules as ""extrinsics."" Extrincing this distinction is an artful way of stating the fact that molecules behave like ""molecules"" of infinite dimensions. This artifice allows us to measure the properties of the molecules we test by using atomic and molecular interactions like the atom, hydrogen, and oxygen. And this also allows for a wide array of methods within macrobiology to verify the value of our knowledge. The use of chemical laws of physics to define and apply natural and theoretical processes will expand our understanding of fundamental processes that affect many types of information.

For example, molecules are a group of atoms with infinitely many nuclei, which are of a type that is a superorganism. However, in certain cases where new nucleons are discovered for the first time, an analysis of this type of molecule will reveal the presence of more- or less-extraparallel elements",0.21813477524759556,0.1764705832363756,0.18988665710186514
Physical conditions for Jupiter-like dynamo models,"  The Juno mission will measure Jupiter's magnetic field with unprecedented
precision and provide a wealth of additional data that will allow to constrain
the planet's interior structure and dynamics. Here we analyse 66 numerical
simulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated
magnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model
VIP4 and up-to-date interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as
benchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like magnetic fields can be found for
a number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal gas or
use the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no
difference. However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads
to strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost
when the convective driving is too strong. The required intermediate range that
yields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties. The
second factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a
product of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We
find that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a good proxy for the top of
the dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole is
once more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to
Jupiter and the result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the
planetary radius.
  The zonal flows in our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely
confined to the molecular layer. Where the jet reaches down to higher
electrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega dynamo
that modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet. This
secondary dynamo can lead to strong magnetic field patches at low latitudes
that seem compatible with the VIP4 model.
","Physical conditions for Jupiter-like dynamo models are the smallest known. At their closest extreme point, Mercury's inner core is much larger than that of Saturn.

And Venus, like Jupiter, is extremely thin so it has trouble separating out Earth-based stars from the sun. Mars would be an obvious candidate. According to calculations by G.E. Cohen, the top temperature at which the central core of Jupiter would have formed could be as low as 5°F. Because the density of the core varies so much from solar system to solar systems (even within Earth's magnetic field), the lower upper temperatures of Earth should make it difficult to detect a true tidal event, but would make a very large event that may have taken place even farther out. The lower temperatures would allow a tidal impact at a much greater distance from Saturn, creating a significant shock wave similar to one experienced in an earthquake there, where a strong magnetic shock would blow Earth away from that zone of cold, molten disk. Earth could not withstand its shock as far back as a few hundred years, when Saturn and Jupiter were just a hundred, with no visible signs of tidal events.


So that's what Jupiter had to offer when she was launched: It had a massive, highly magnetic core. Jupiter is about 150 million years older than Earth, and is in a close orbit around Jupiter. Yet we have no way to find out about its inner workings. So what is this planet like? What causes it to be so",0.2163998189728375,0.18857142357551032,0.17530251318647225
Super-Nyquist asteroseismology with the Kepler Space Telescope,"  Barycentric corrections made to the timing of Kepler observations,
necessitated by variations in light arrival time at the satellite, break the
regular time-sampling of the data -- the time stamps are periodically
modulated. A consequence is that Nyquist aliases are split into multiplets that
can be identified by their shape. Real pulsation frequencies are
distinguishable from these aliases and their frequencies are completely
recoverable, even in the super-Nyquist regime, that is, when the sampling
interval is longer than half the pulsation period. We provide an analytical
derivation of the phenomenon, alongside demonstrations with simulated and real
Kepler data for \delta Sct, roAp, and sdBV stars. For Kepler data sets spanning
more than one Kepler orbital period (372.5 d), there are no Nyquist ambiguities
on the determination of pulsation frequencies, which are the fundamental data
of asteroseismology.

Benchmarking Fast-to-Alfven Mode Conversion in a Cold MHD Plasma,"  Alfv\'en waves may be generated via mode conversion from fast
magneto-acoustic waves near their reflection level in the solar atmosphere,
with implications both for coronal oscillations and for active region
helio-seismology. In active regions this reflection typically occurs high
enough that the Alfv\'en speed $a$ greatly exceeds the sound speed $c$, well
above the $a=c$ level where the fast and slow modes interact. In order to focus
on the fundamental characteristics of fast/Alfv\'en conversion, stripped of
unnecessary detail, it is therefore useful to freeze out the slow mode by
adopting the gravitationally stratified cold MHD model $c\to0$. This provides a
benchmark for fast-to-Alfv\'en mode conversion in more complex atmospheres.
Assuming a uniform inclined magnetic field and an exponential Alfv\'en speed
profile with density scale height $h$, the Alfv\'en conversion coefficient
depends on three variables only; the dimensionless
transverse-to-the-stratification wavenumber $\kappa=kh$, the magnetic field
inclination from the stratification direction $\theta$, and the polarization
angle $\phi$ of the wavevector relative to the plane containing the
stratification and magnetic field directions. We present an extensive
exploration of mode conversion in this parameter space and conclude that
near-total conversion to outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves typically occurs
for small $\theta$ and large $\phi$ ($80^\circ$--$90^\circ$), though it is
absent entirely when $\theta$ is exactly zero (vertical field). For wavenumbers
of helioseismic interest, the conversion region is broad enough to encompass
the whole chromosphere.

injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the cavity. We
work in the resolved sideband regime. We find that in order to obtain the
maximum momentum squeezing of the movable mirror, the squeezing parameter of
the input light should be about 1. We can obtain more than 70% squeezing.
Besides, for a fixed squeezing parameter, decreasing the temperature of the
environment or increasing the laser power increases the momentum squeezing. We
find very large squeezing with respect to thermal fluctuations, for instance at
1 mK, the momentum fluctuations go down by a factor more than one hundred.

Learning Graph Topological Features via GAN,"  Inspired by the generation power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in
image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning
characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via
GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both
local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input
graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate
reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the
associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces
subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early
reconstruction stages (unlike a single GAN, which cannot easily identify such
features, let alone reconstruct the original graph). This paper is firstline

"Limit theory for geometric statistics of point processes having fast
  decay of correlations","  Let $P$ be a simple,stationary point process having fast decay of
correlations, i.e., its correlation functions factorize up to an additive error
decaying faster than any power of the separation distance. Let $P_n:= P \cap
W_n$ be its restriction to windows $W_n:= [-{1 \over 2}n^{1/d},{1 \over
2}n^{1/d}]^d \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We consider the statistic $H_n^\xi:=
\sum_{x \in P_n}\xi(x,P_n)$ where $\xi(x,P_n)$ denotes a score function
representing the interaction of $x$ with respect to $P_n$. When $\xi$ depends
on local data in the sense that its radius of stabilization has an exponential
tail, we establish expectation asymptotics, variance asymptotics, and CLT for
$H_n^{\xi}$ and, more generally, for statistics of the re-scaled, possibly
signed, $\xi$-weighted point measures $\mu_n^{\xi} := \sum_{x \in P_n}
\xi(x,P_n) \delta_{n^{-1/d}x}$, as $W_n \uparrow \mathbb{R}^d$. This gives the
limit theory for non-linear geometric statistics (such as clique counts,
intrinsic volumes of the Boolean model, and total edge length of the
$k$-nearest neighbors graph) of $\alpha$-determinantal point processes having
fast decreasing kernels extending the CLTs of Soshnikov (2002) to non-linear
statistics. It also gives the limit theory for geometric U-statistics of
$\alpha$-permanental point processes and the zero set of Gaussian entire
functions, extending the CLTs of Nazarov and Sodin (2012) and Shirai and
Takahashi (2003), which are also confined to linear statistics. The proof of
the central limit theorem relies on a factorial moment expansion originating in
Blaszczyszyn (1995), Blaszczyszyn, Merzbach, Schmidt (1997) to show the fast
decay of the correlations of $\xi$-weighted point measures. The latter property
is shown to imply a condition equivalent to Brillinger mixing and consequently
yields the CLT for $\mu_n^\xi$ via an extension of the cumulant method.

Compositories and Gleaves,"  Sheaves are objects of a local nature: a global section is determined by how
it looks locally. Hence, a sheaf cannot describe mathematical structures which
contain global or nonlocal geometric information. To fill this gap, we
introduce the theory of ""gleaves"", which are presheaves equipped with an
additional ""gluing operation"" of compatible pairs of local sections. This
generalizes the conditional product structures of Dawid and Studen\'y, which
correspond to gleaves on distributive lattices. Our examples include the gleaf
of metric spaces and the gleaf of joint probability distributions. A result of
Johnstone shows that a category of gleaves can have a subobject classifier
despite not being cartesian closed.
  Gleaves over the simplex category $\Delta$, which we call compositories, can
be interpreted as a new kind of higher category in which the composition of an
$m$-morphism and an $n$-morphism along a common $k$-morphism face results in an
$(m+n-k)$-morphism. The distinctive feature of this composition operation is
that the original morphisms can be recovered from the composite morphism as
initial and final faces. Examples of compositories include nerves of categories
and compositories of higher spans.

spanning subgraphs into which the graph $G$ can be decomposed. As a topological

the thickness of graphs that are obtained by vertex-amalgamation and
bar-amalgamation of any two graphs whose thicknesses are known are obtained,
respectively. And the lower and upper bounds for the thickness of graphs that
are obtained by edge-amalgamation and 2-vertex-amalgamation of any two graphs

several columns belong to $L$ or not. This distinguisher is obtained by
considering the code generated by component-wise products of codewords of the
public code (the so called ""square code""). This operation is applied to
punctured versions of this square code obtained by picking a subset
  $I$ of the whole set of columns. It turns out that the dimension of the
punctured square code is directly related to the cardinality of the
intersection of $I$ with $L$. This allows an attack which recovers the full set

"Contribution to Temporal Fault Tree Analysis without Modularization and
  Transformation into the State Space","  Background:
  Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a well established method for qualitative as
well as probabilistic reliability and safety analysis. As a Boolean model it
does not support modelling of dynamic effects like sequence dependencies
between fault events. This work describes a method that allows consideration of
sequence dependencies without transformations into state-space.
  Concept:
  The new temporal fault tree analysis (TFTA) described in this work extends
the Boolean FTA. The TFTA is based on a new temporal logic which adds a concept
of time to the Boolean logic and algebra. This allows modelling of temporal
relationships between events using two new temporal operators (PAND and SAND).
With a set of temporal logic rules, a given temporal term may be simplified to
its temporal disjunctive normal form (TDNF) which is similar to the Boolean DNF
but includes event sequencies. In TDNF the top event's temporal system function
may be reduced to a list of minimal cutset sequences (MCSS). These allow
qualitative analyses similar to Boolean cutset analysis in normal FTA.
Furthermore the TFTA may also be used for probabilistic analyses without using
state-space models.
  Results:
  One significant aspect of the new TFTA described in this work is the
possibility to take sequence dependencies into account for qualitative and
probabilistic analyses without state-space transformations. Among others, this
allows for modelling of event sequencies at all levels within a fault tree, a
real qualitative analysis similar to the FTA's cutset analysis, and
quantification of sequence dependencies within the same model.

The Slab Method to Measure the Topological Susceptibility,"  In simulations of a model with topological sectors, algorithms which proceed
in small update steps tend to get stuck in one sector, especially on fine
lattices. This distorts the numerical results; in particular it is not
straightforward to measure the topological susceptibility chi_t. We test a
method to measure chi_t even if configurations from only one sector are
available. It is based on the topological charges in sub-volumes, which we
denote as ""slab"". This enables the evaluation of chi_t, as we demonstrate with
numerical results for non-linear sigma-models and for 2-flavour QCD. In the
latter case, the gradient flow is applied for the smoothing of the gauge
configurations, and the slab method results for chi_t are stable over a broad
range of flow times.

Extinction time of the logistic process,"  The logistic birth and death process is perhaps the simplest stochastic
population model that has both density-dependent reproduction, and a phase
transition, and a lot can be learned about the process by studying its
extinction time, $\tau_n$, as a function of system size $n$. A number of
existing results describe the scaling of $\tau_n$ as $n\to\infty$, for various
choices of reproductive rate $r_n$ and initial population $X_n(0)$ as a
function of $n$. We collect and complete this picture, obtaining a complete
classification of all sequences $(r_n)$ and $(X_n(0))$ for which there exist
rescaling parameters $(s_n)$ and $(t_n)$ such that $(\tau_n-t_n)/s_n$ converges
in distribution as $n\to\infty$, and identifying the limits in each case.

"Ground state properties of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ determined from
  $\textit{ab initio}$ Hamiltonian and its extensions containing Kitaev and
  extended Heisenberg interactions","  We investigate the ground state properties of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ based on
numerical calculations of the recently proposed {\it ab initio} Hamiltonian
represented by Kitaev and extended Heisenberg interactions. To overcome the
limitation posed by small tractable system sizes in the exact diagonalization
study employed in a previous study (Yamaji $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett.
$\textbf{113}$, 107201 (2014)), we apply two-dimensional density matrix
renomalization group, and infinite-size tensor-network method. By calculating
at much larger system sizes, we critically test the validity of the exact
diagonalization results. The results consistently indicate that the ground
state of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ is a magnetically ordered state with zigzag
configuration in agreement with experimental observations and the previous
diagonalization study. Applications of the two independent methods in addition
to the exact diagonalization study further uncover a consistent and rich phase
diagram near the zigzag phase beyond the accessibility of the exact
diagonalization. For example, in the parameter space away from the $\textit{ab
initio}$ value of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ controlled by the trigonal distortion,
we find three phases: (i) an ordered phase with the magnetic moment aligned
mutually in $120$ degrees orientation on every third hexagon, (ii) a
magnetically ordered phase with a $16$-site unit-cell, and (iii) an ordered
phase with presumably incommensurate periodicity of the moment. It suggests
that potentially rich magnetic structures may appear in
$A_\mathrm{2}\mathrm{IrO_3}$ compounds for $A$ other than Na. The present
results also serve to establish the accuracy of the first-principles approach
in reproducing the available experimental results thereby further contribute to
find a route to realize the Kitaev spin liquid.

k-anonymity and differential privacy. Users were asked to pick a preferred
sharing scenario depending on the recipient of the data, the benefit of sharing
data, the type of data, and the parameterized privacy. Users disagreed with
sharing data for commercial purposes regarding mental illnesses and with high
de-anonymization risks but showed little concern when data is used for

"Theory of oxidation/reduction-induced chromium ion valence
  transformations in Cr,Ca:YAG crystals","  In their paper [Opt. Mater. 24, 333, 2003], Feldman et al conducted an
experimental study of the dynamics of chromium ion valence transformations in
Cr,Ca:YAG crystals among the trivalent Cr3+ state, and two tetravalent Cr4+
ones, of octahedral and tetrahedral coordination. The temperatures used ranged
between ~800 and 1,000 C. The basic effects are the transition of Cr3+ into
Cr4+ under high-temperature annealing in an oxidizing atmosphere, and the
reverse transition under a reducing atmosphere, or in vacuum. In the present
theory, we interpret the processes by oxygen-vacancy diffusion in the bulk of
the YAG. The quasi-chemical reaction VO2- + Cr4+ = Cr3+/VO- between the
chromium ions and the vacancies VO2- is responsible for the valence
transformations. Dynamical analysis provides profiles of the Cr3+ and Cr4+
concentrations in the crystal during oxidation and during reduction. Reaction
rate profiles are also calculated, establishing the reaction front position and
width. A comparison with existing experimental results on the integrated Cr4+
concentration as a function of time during oxidation [Opt. Mater. 24, 333,

Liquid crystals of hard rectangles on flat and cylindrical manifolds,"  Using the classical density functional theory of freezing and Monte Carlo
computer simulations, we explore the liquid-crystalline phase behavior of hard
rectangles on flat and cylindrical manifolds. Moreover, we study the effect of
a static external field which couples to the rectangles' orientations, aligning
them towards a preferred direction. In the flat and field-free case, the bulk
phase diagram involves stable isotropic, nematic, tetratic, and smectic phases
depending on the aspect ratio and number density of the particles. The external
field shifts the transition lines significantly and generates a binematic phase
at the expense of the tetratic phase. On a cylindrical manifold, we observe
tilted smectic-like order, as obtained by wrapping a smectic layer around a
cylinder. We find in general good agreement between our density functional
calculations and particle-resolved computer simulations and mention possible
setups to verify our predictions in experiments.

The expected neutral frequency spectrum of linked sites,"  We present an exact, closed expression for the expected neutral Site
Frequency Spectrum for two neutral sites, 2-SFS, without recombination. This
spectrum is the immediate extension of the well known single site $\theta/f$
neutral SFS. Similar formulae are also provided for the case of the expected
SFS of sites that are linked to a focal neutral mutation of known frequency.
Formulae for finite samples are obtained by coalescent methods and remarkably
simple expressions are derived for the SFS of a large population, which are

A Computational Method for Sharp Interface Advection,"  We devise a numerical method for passive advection of a surface, such as the
interface between two incompressible fluids, across a computational mesh. The
method is called isoAdvector, and is developed for general meshes consisting of
arbitrary polyhedral cells. The algorithm is based on the volume of fluid (VOF)
idea of calculating the volume of one of the fluids transported across the mesh
faces during a time step. The novelty of the isoAdvector concept consists in
two parts: First, we exploit an isosurface concept for modelling the interface
inside cells in a geometric surface reconstruction step. Second, from the
reconstructed surface, we model the motion of the face-interface intersection
line for a general polygonal face to obtain the time evolution within a time
step of the submerged face area. Integrating this submerged area over the time
step leads to an accurate estimate for the total volume of fluid transported
across the face. The method was tested on simple 2D and 3D interface advection
problems both on structured and unstructured meshes. The results are very
satisfactory both in terms of volume conservation, boundedness, surface
sharpness, and efficiency. The isoAdvector method was implemented as an
OpenFOAM(R) extension and is published as open source.

Quantum entanglement of nanocantilevers,"  We propose a scheme to entangle two mechanical nanocantilevers through
indirect interactions mediated by a gas of ultra cold atoms. We envisage a
system of nanocantilevers magnetically coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of
atoms and focus on studying the dark states of the system. These dark states
are entangled states of the two nanocantilevers, with no coupling to the atomic
condensate. In the absence of dissipation, the degree of entanglement is found
to oscillate with time, while if dissipation is included, the system is found
to relax to a statistical mixture of dark states which remains time independent
until the inevitable thermal dephasing destroys the nanocantilever coherence.
This opens up the possibility of achieving long-lived entangled nanocantilever
states.

quasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). We derived the extinction curves using Fitzpatrick &
Massa 1986 (FM) law by comparing the observed SEDs to the combined quasar
template from Vanden Berk et al. 2001 and Glikman et al. 2006. The derived
extinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction
curves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a
weighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction
curve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean
values of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well
fit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\pm0.2$. The `average quasar
extinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction
curves at a confidence level $\gtrsim95\%$. Such steep extinction curves
suggest a significant population of silicates to produce small dust grains.
Moreover, another possibility could be that the large dust grains may have been
destroyed by the activity of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), resulting
in steep extinction curves.

A detailed explanation of the eti-dynamic process in which the observed data undergoes perturbations and the implications for the prediction of a post-explosion model is described in the Supplementary Materials. There is a significant correlation between the intensity of perturbed surface radiation (t/z) in a region and a response to irradiation and some of these correlations correlate with the proportion of exposed areas where a perturbing pertraction is expected and thus the relative probability that the exposure is proportional to the pertracted radiative response (e.g., p ~ 0.5 + a t > 50 ) and may be due to differences in pertinacy (in particular the change in response density, which is often described by the equation of γ t = a a ) [31], [32].

In the context of large global population-level pertidence (i.e., mass extinction), we therefore infer that there is an average and sufficient absolute intensity associated with pertuzations of r 0 and r 1, respectively, with low pertu-ments (no changes in r t ).

Ethical Aspects of Internet of Things from Islamic Perspective,"  The Internet of Things (IoTs) is an evolving new face of technology that
provides state of the art services using ubiquitously connected smart objects.
These smart objects are capable of sensing, processing, collaborating,
communicating the events and provide services. The IoT is a collection of

These technologies enable smart objects to identify objects, collect
information about their status,communicating the collected information for
taking some desired actions. Widespread adaptations of IoT based devices and

  Criticality Scenario","  It has been shown that changes in the energy of a system of nonwetting-liquid
clusters confined in a random nanoporous medium in the process of relaxation
can be written in the quasiparticle approximation in the form of the sum of the
energies of local (metastable) configurations of liquid clusters interacting
with clusters in the connected nearest pores. The energy spectrum and density
of states of the local configuration have been calculated. It has been shown
that the relaxation of the state of the system occurs through the scenario of
self-organized criticality (SOC). The process is characterized by the
expectation of a fluctuation necessary for overcoming a local energy barrier of
the metastable state with the subsequent rapid hydrodynamic extrusion of the
liquid under the action of the surface buoyancy forces of the nonwetting
framework. In this case, the dependence of the interaction between local
configurations on the number of filled pores belonging to the infinite
percolation cluster of filled pores serves as an internal feedback initiating
the SOC process. The calculations give a power-law time dependence of the
relative volume of the confined liquid. The developed model of the relaxation
of the porous medium with the nonwetting liquid demonstrates possible
mechanisms and scenarios of SOC for disordered atomic systems.

"Inflation in exponential scalar model and finite-time singularity
  induced instability","  We investigate how a Type IV future singularity can be included in the
cosmological evolution of a well-known exponential model of inflation. In order
to achieve this we use a two scalar field model, in the context of which the
incorporation of the Type IV singularity can be consistently done. In the
context of the exponential model we study, when a Type IV singularity is
included in the evolution, an instability occurs in the slow-roll parameters,
and in particular on the second slow-roll parameter. Particularly, if we
abandon the slow-roll condition for both the scalars we shall use, then the
most consistent description of the dynamics of the inflationary era is provided
by the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\epsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$. Then, the second
Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$, which measures the duration of the
inflationary era, becomes singular at the point where the Type IV singularity
is chosen to occur, while the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$ is
regular there. Therefore, this infinite singularity indicates that the
occurrence of the finite-time singularity is responsible for the instability in
the scalar field model we study. This sort of instability has it's imprint on
the dynamical system that can be constructed from the cosmological equations,
with the dynamical system being unstable. In addition, the instability due to
the singularity mechanism we propose, is discussed in the context of other
inflationary scalar potentials. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a
singularity in the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we also critically discuss
qualitatively, what implications could this effect have on the graceful exit
problem of the exponential model.

"Efficient metallic spintronic emitters of ultrabroadband terahertz
  radiation","  Terahertz electromagnetic radiation is extremely useful for numerous
applications such as imaging and spectroscopy. Therefore, it is highly
desirable to have an efficient table-top emitter covering the 1-to-30-THz
window whilst being driven by a low-cost, low-power femtosecond laser
oscillator. So far, all solid-state emitters solely exploit physics related to
the electron charge and deliver emission spectra with substantial gaps. Here,
we take advantage of the electron spin to realize a conceptually new terahertz
source which relies on tailored fundamental spintronic and photonic phenomena
in magnetic metal multilayers: ultrafast photo-induced spin currents, the
inverse spin-Hall effect and a broadband Fabry-P\'erot resonance. Guided by an
analytical model, such spintronic route offers unique possibilities for
systematic optimization. We find that a 5.8-nm-thick W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer
generates ultrashort pulses fully covering the 1-to-30-THz range. Our novel
source outperforms laser-oscillator-driven emitters such as ZnTe(110) crystals

"Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European
  languages in Europe","  We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000
years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost four
hundred thousand polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the
sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around
250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than
previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the
populations of western and far eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories
between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in
Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers
appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous
hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of
hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6 . By
~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred
throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this
time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European
hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and
Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded
Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,
documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern
periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans
until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans.
These results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least
some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.

Improved distance determination to M51 from supernovae 2011dh and 2005cs,"  The appearance of two recent supernovae, SN 2011dh and 2005cs, both in M51,
provides an opportunity to derive an improved distance to their host galaxy by
combining the observations of both SNe. We apply the Expanding Photosphere
Method to get the distance to M51 by fitting the data of these two SNe
simultaneously. In order to correct for the effect of flux dilution, we use
correction factors (zeta) appropriate for standard type II-P SNe atmospheres
for 2005cs, but find zeta ~ 1 for the type IIb SN 2011dh, which may be due to
the reduced H-content of its ejecta. The EPM analysis resulted in D_M51 = 8.4
+/- 0.7 Mpc. Based on this improved distance, we also re-analyze the HST
observations of the proposed progenitor of SN 2011dh. We confirm that the
object detected on the pre-explosion HST-images is unlikely to be a compact
stellar cluster. In addition, its derived radius (~ 277$ R_sun) is too large
for being the real (exploded) progenitor of SN 2011dh. The supernova-based

examine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one of
the two prominent hosts in the Local Group (i.e. the Milky Way and the
Andromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects ""renegade subhaloes"". In
light of recent claims that the two Magellanic Clouds (MCs) may have originated
from another region (or even the outskirts) of the Local Group or that they
have been spawned by a major merger in the past of the Andromeda galaxy, we
investigate the nature of such events. However, we cannot confirm that renegade
subhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor that
they share the most simplest properties with the MCs, namely mass and relative
velocity. Our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appear
to be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. A merger is not
required to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of our
simulated Local Group facilitating such behavior. Since just a small fraction
of the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that it
will be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differences
in their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

CPL: A Core Language for Cloud Computing -- Technical Report,"  Running distributed applications in the cloud involves deployment. That is,
distribution and configuration of application services and middleware
infrastructure. The considerable complexity of these tasks resulted in the
emergence of declarative JSON-based domain-specific deployment languages to
develop deployment programs. However, existing deployment programs unsafely
compose artifacts written in different languages, leading to bugs that are hard
to detect before run time. Furthermore, deployment languages do not provide
extension points for custom implementations of existing cloud services such as
application-specific load balancing policies.
  To address these shortcomings, we propose CPL (Cloud Platform Language), a
statically-typed core language for programming both distributed applications as
well as their deployment on a cloud platform. In CPL, application services and
deployment programs interact through statically typed, extensible interfaces,
and an application can trigger further deployment at run time. We provide a
formal semantics of CPL and demonstrate that it enables type-safe, composable
and extensible libraries of service combinators, such as load balancing and
fault tolerance.

Dynamical evolution of a bulge in an N-body model of the Milky Way,"  The detailed dynamical structure of the bulge in the Milky Way is currently

"Shaping nanoparticle fingerprints at the interface of cholesteric
  droplets","  The ordering of nanoparticles into predetermined configurations is of
importance to the design of advanced technologies. In this work, we moderate
the surface anchoring against the bulk elasticity of liquid crystals to
dynamically shape nanoparticle assemblies at a fluid interface. By tuning the
degree of nanoparticle hydrophobicity with surfactants that alter the molecular
anchoring of liquid crystals, we pattern nanoparticles at the interface of
cholesteric liquid crystal emulsions. Adjusting the particle hydrophobicity
more finely further modifies the rigidity of assemblies. We establish that
patterns are tunable by varying both surfactant and chiral dopant
concentrations. Since particle assembly occurs at the interface with the
desired structures exposed to the surrounding phase, we demonstrate that
particles can be readily crosslinked and manipulated, forming structures that
retain their shape under external perturbations. This study establishes the
templating of nanomaterials into reconfigurable arrangements. Interfacial
assembly is tempered by elastic patterns that arise from the geometric
frustration of confined cholesterics. This work serves as a basis for creating
materials with chemical heterogeneity and with linear, periodic structures,
essential for optical and energy applications.

Magnetotransport properties of individual InAs nanowires,"  We probe the magnetotransport properties of individual InAs nanowires in a
field effect transistor geometry. In the low magnetic field regime we observe
magnetoresistance that is well described by the weak localization (WL)
description in diffusive conductors. The weak localization correction is
modified to weak anti-localization (WAL) as the gate voltage is increased. We
show that the gate voltage can be used to tune the phase coherence length
($l_\phi$) and spin-orbit length ($l_{so}$) by a factor of $\sim$ 2. In the
high field and low temperature regime we observe the mobility of devices can be
modified significantly as a function of magnetic field. We argue that the role
of skipping orbits and the nature of surface scattering is essential in
understanding high field magnetotransport in nanowires.

Optimal classical simulation of state-independent quantum contextuality,"  Simulating quantum contextuality with classical systems requires memory. A
fundamental yet open question is what is the minimum memory needed and,
therefore, the precise sense in which quantum systems outperform classical
ones. Here, we make rigorous the notion of classically simulating quantum
state-independent contextuality (QSIC) in the case of a single quantum system
submitted to an infinite sequence of measurements randomly chosen from a finite
QSIC set. We obtain the minimum memory needed to simulate arbitrary QSIC sets
via classical systems under the assumption that the simulation should not
contain any oracular information. In particular, we show that, while
classically simulating two qubits tested with the Peres-Mermin set requires
$\log_2 24 \approx 4.585$ bits, simulating a single qutrit tested with the
Yu-Oh set requires, at least, $5.740$ bits.
","Optimal classical simulation of state-independent quantum contextuality under conditions like the finite state conditions. For example, an optimal classical state for the nonconcrete quantum state is an ideal state in classical simulations of quantum computation using the pre-computed state. Although the optimality of the optimal state under such conditions should also be considered for our application of superposition for quantum information theory, the implementation should only take place if there is not enough computation by the computational state to prevent any potential out-of-state events. The optimization may occur for a quantum quantum system that may be in a highly specific, or more complex, mode of operation",0.26830303693616725,0.1999999951125001,0.18084676881382986
"Bondi or not Bondi: the impact of resolution on accretion and drag force
  modelling for Supermassive Black Holes","  Whilst in galaxy-size simulations, supermassive black holes (SMBH) are
entirely handled by sub-grid algorithms, computational power now allows the
accretion radius of such objects to be resolved in smaller scale simulations.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of resolution on two commonly used
SMBH sub-grid algorithms; the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) formula for accretion
onto a point mass, and the related estimate of the drag force exerted onto a
point mass by a gaseous medium. We find that when the accretion region around
the black hole scales with resolution, and the BHL formula is evaluated using
local mass-averaged quantities, the accretion algorithm smoothly transitions
from the analytic BHL formula (at low resolution) to a supply limited accretion
(SLA) scheme (at high resolution). However, when a similar procedure is
employed to estimate the drag force it can lead to significant errors in its
magnitude, and/or apply this force in the wrong direction in highly resolved
simulations. At high Mach numbers and for small accretors, we also find
evidence of the advective-acoustic instability operating in the adiabatic case,
and of an instability developing around the wake's stagnation point in the
quasi-isothermal case. Moreover, at very high resolution, and Mach numbers
above $\mathcal{M}_\infty \geq 3$, the flow behind the accretion bow shock
becomes entirely dominated by these instabilities. As a result, accretion rates
onto the black hole drop by about an order of magnitude in the adiabatic case,
compared to the analytic BHL formula.

Inhomogeneous vacuum energy,"  Vacuum energy remains the simplest model of dark energy which could drive the
accelerated expansion of the Universe without necessarily introducing any new
degrees of freedom. Inhomogeneous vacuum energy is necessarily interacting in
general relativity. Although the four-velocity of vacuum energy is undefined,
an interacting vacuum has an energy transfer and the vacuum energy defines a
particular foliation of spacetime with spatially homogeneous vacuum energy in
cosmological solutions. It is possible to give a consistent description of
vacuum dynamics and in particular the relativistic equations of motion for
inhomogeneous perturbations given a covariant prescription for the vacuum
energy, or equivalently the energy transfer four-vector, and we construct
gauge-invariant vacuum perturbations. We show that any dark energy cosmology
can be decomposed into an interacting vacuum+matter cosmology whose
inhomogeneous perturbations obey simple first-order equations.
","Inhomogeneous vacuum energy transfer has been demonstrated using vacuum gas, thermal radiation to make a vacuum field (TFT). All of us use an inertial vacuum (IPV), but in addition to the physical vacuum that we use for the energy we have to carry an energy storage and storage tank into a nonzero state if we are going to be using static electricity, which will also be used by the solar industry and the automotive industry.

"Mesoscopic Kinetic Basis of Macroscopic Chemical Thermodynamics: A
  Mathematical Theory","  From a mathematical model that describes a complex chemical kinetic system of
$N$ species and $M$ elementrary reactions in a rapidly stirred vessel of size
$V$ as a Markov process, we show that a macroscopic chemical thermodynamics
emerges as $V\rightarrow\infty$. The theory is applicable to linear and
nonlinear reactions, closed systems reaching chemical equilibrium, or open,
driven systems approaching to nonequilibrium steady states. A generalized
mesoscopic free energy gives rise to a macroscopic chemical energy function
$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$ where $\vx=(x_1,\cdots,x_N)$ are the concentrations of the
$N$ chemical species. The macroscopic chemical dynamics $\vx(t)$ satisfies two
emergent laws: (1) $(\rd/\rd t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]\le 0$, and (2)$(\rd/\rd
t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]=\text{cmf}(\vx)-\sigma(\vx)$ where entropy production
rate $\sigma\ge 0$ represents the sink for the chemical energy, and chemical
motive force $\text{cmf}\ge 0$ is non-zero if the system is driven under a
sustained nonequilibrium chemostat. For systems with detailed balance
$\text{cmf}=0$, and if one assumes the law of mass action,$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$
is precisely the Gibbs' function $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\mu_i^o+\ln x_i\big]$
for ideal solutions. For a class of kinetic systems called complex balanced,
which include many nonlinear systems as well as many simple open, driven
chemical systems, the $\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$, with global minimum at $\vx^*$, has
the generic form $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\ln(x_i/x_i^*)-x_i+x_i^*\big]$,which has
been known in chemical kinetic literature.Macroscopic emergent ""laws"" are
independent of the details of the underlying kinetics. This theory provides a
concrete example from chemistry showing how a dynamic macroscopic law can
emerge from the kinetics at a level below.

"Challenges of Profile Likelihood Evaluation in Multi-Dimensional SUSY
  Scans","  Statistical inference of the fundamental parameters of supersymmetric
theories is a challenging and active endeavor. Several sophisticated algorithms
have been employed to this end. While Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
nested sampling techniques are geared towards Bayesian inference, they have
also been used to estimate frequentist confidence intervals based on the
profile likelihood ratio. We investigate the performance and appropriate
configuration of MultiNest, a nested sampling based algorithm, when used for
profile likelihood-based analyses both on toy models and on the parameter space
of the Constrained MSSM. We find that while the standard configuration is
appropriate for an accurate reconstruction of the Bayesian posterior, the
profile likelihood is poorly approximated. We identify a more appropriate
MultiNest configuration for profile likelihood analyses, which gives an
excellent exploration of the profile likelihood (albeit at a larger
computational cost), including the identification of the global maximum
likelihood value. We conclude that with the appropriate configuration MultiNest
is a suitable tool for profile likelihood studies, indicating previous claims
to the contrary are not well founded.

"Convergence of time averages of weak solutions of the three-dimensional

notion of invariant measure, it is proved that, in a suitable sense, time
averages of almost every Leray-Hopf weak solution of the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge as the averaging time goes to
infinity. This system of equations is not known to be globally well-posed, and
the above result answers a long-standing problem, extending to this system a
classical result from ergodic theory. It is also showed that, from a
measure-theoretic point of view, the stationary statistical solution obtained
from a generalized limit of time averages is independent of the choice of the
generalized limit. Finally, any Borel subset of the phase space with positive
measure with respect to a stationary statistical solution is such that for
almost all initial conditions in that Borel set and for at least one Leray-Hopf
weak solution starting with that initial condition, the corresponding orbit is
recurrent to that Borel subset and its mean sojourn time within that Borel
subset is strictly positive.

Masking line foregrounds in intensity mapping surveys,"  We address the problem of line confusion in intensity mapping surveys and
explore the possibility to mitigate line foreground contamination by
progressively masking the brightest pixels in the observed map. We consider
experiments targeting CO(1-0) at $z=3$, Ly$\alpha$ at $z=7$, and CII at $z=7$,
and use simulated intensity maps, which include both clustering and shot noise
components of the signal and possible foregrounds, in order to test the
efficiency of our method. We find that for CO and Ly$\alpha$ it is quite
possible to remove most of the foreground contribution from the maps via only
1%-3% pixel masking. The CII maps will be more difficult to clean, however, due
to instrumental constraints and the high-intensity foreground contamination
involved. While the masking procedure sacrifices much of the astrophysical
information present in our maps, we demonstrate that useful cosmological
information in the targeted lines can be successfully retrieved.
","Masking line foregrounds in intensity mapping surveys, such as the ones used by the FRSI, have become increasingly important to understand.

Neural Models for Documents with Metadata,"  Most real-world document collections involve various types of metadata, such
as author, source, and date, and yet the most commonly-used approaches to
modeling text corpora ignore this information. While specialized models have

customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In
this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and
propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible
incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative
models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff
between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the

(SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process (DY) by employing the quasi-classical
Glauber-Mueller/ McLerran-Venugopalan approximation. Modeling the hadron as a
large ""nucleus"" with non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM), we find that its
Sivers function receives two dominant contributions: one contribution is due to
the OAM, while another one is due to the local Sivers function density in the
nucleus. While the latter mechanism, being due to the ""lensing"" interactions,
dominates at large transverse momentum of the produced hadron in SIDIS or of
the di-lepton pair in DY, the former (OAM) mechanism is leading in saturation
power counting and dominates when the above transverse momenta become of the
order of the saturation scale. We show that the OAM channel allows for a
particularly simple and intuitive interpretation of the celebrated sign flip

is based on a recent two-dimensional generalized-gradient approximation derived
by considering the limits of small and large density gradients. The fully local
correlation part is constructed following the Colle-Salvetti scheme and a
Gaussian approximation for the pair density. The combination of these
expressions is shown to provide an efficient density functional to calculate
the total energies of two-dimensional electron systems such as semiconductor
quantum dots. Excellent performance of the functional with respect to
numerically exact reference data for quantum dots is demonstrated.
","Semi-local density functional for the exchange-correlation energy of
  electrons in two dimensions, e.g., (6) has the same value in three dimensions

"Star formation in low density HI gas around the Elliptical Galaxy
  NGC2865","  Interacting galaxies surrounded by HI tidal debris are ideal sites for the
study of young clusters and tidal galaxy formation. The process that triggers
star formation in the low-density environments outside galaxies is still an
open question. New clusters and galaxies of tidal origin are expected to have
high metallicities for their luminosities. Spectroscopy of such objects is,
however, at the limit of what can be done with existing 8-10m class telescopes,
which has prevented statistical studies of these objects. NGC2865 is an
UV-bright merging elliptical galaxy with shells and extended HI tails. The
regions observed in this work were previously detected using multi-slit imaging
spectroscopy. We obtain new multislit spectroscopy of six young star-forming
regions around NGC2865, to determine their redshifts and metallicities. The six
emission-line regions are located 16-40 kpc from NGC2865 and they have similar
redshifts. They have ages of ~10Myears and an average metallicity of
12+log(O/H) ~ 8.6, suggesting a tidal origin for the regions. It is noted that
they coincide with an extended HI tail, which has projected density of N$_{HI}$
< 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and displays a low surface brightness counterpart. These
regions may represent the youngest of the three populations of star clusters
already identified in NGC2865. The high, nearly-solar, oxygen abundances found
for the six regions in the vicinity of NGC2865 suggest that they were formed by
pre-enriched material from the parent galaxy, from gas removed during the last
major merger. Given the mass and the location of the HII regions, we can
speculate that these young star-forming regions are potential precursors of
globular clusters that will be part of the halo of NGC2865 in the future. Our
result supports the use of the multi-slit imaging spectroscopy as a useful tool
for finding nearly-formed stellar systems around galaxies.

"Was a cloud-cloud collision the trigger of the recent star formation in
  Serpens?","  The complexity of the ISM is such that it is unlikely that star formation is
initiated in the same way in all molecular clouds. While some clouds seem to
collapse on their own, others may be triggered by an external event such as a
cloud/flow collision forming a gravitationally unstable enhanced density layer.
This work tests cloud-cloud collisions as the triggering mechanism for star
formation in the Serpens Main Cluster as has been suggested by previous work. A
set of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the collision
between two cylindrical clouds are performed and compared to (sub)millimetre
observations of the Serpens Main Cluster. A configuration has been found which
reproduces many of the observed characteristics of Serpens, including some of
the main features of the peculiar velocity field. The evolution of the velocity
with position throughout the model is similar to that observed and the column
density and masses within the modeled cloud agree with those measured for the
SE sub-cluster. Furthermore, our results also show that an asymmetric collision
provides the ingredients to reproduce lower density filaments perpendicular to
the main structure, similar to those observed. In this scenario, the formation
of the NW sub-cluster of Serpens can be reproduced only if there is a
pre-existing marginally gravitationally unstable region at the time the
collision occurs. This work supports the interpretation that a collision
between two clouds may have been the trigger of the most recent burst of star
formation in Serpens. It not only explains the complicated velocity structure
seen in the region, but also the temperature differences between the north (in
""isolated"" collapse) and the south (resulting from the shock between the
clouds). In addition it provides an explanation for the sources in the south
having a larger spread in age than those in the north.

A star or two on a galactic scale can cause a violent fusion to occur, or cause more.
 'What will happen if a massive star suddenly exploded?'
, This has not been so for the last couple of years. A star of around 150 light years in diameter like this one was able to cause significant fusion due
 to the rapid rate of fusion. The 'exact cause of this fusion' is not known, so it was thought that as soon as the 'prime star' became even brighter, the
'fusion energy' would also have stopped and the star
the planet was close enough to its center of mass could be expelled. However, as a result many stars were more violent than the majority of their light. This phenomenon can produce an Earth planet planet, which was known to be the same size as its star, that is to say, just 5 minutes
s of light in size. So when we say that a planet is close to a Earth that was just a few light-years long, this is a very real possibility. But how many times are things not happening
and so on, where are we? The only known reason for this type of 'laser event' was in the form of an explosion of a 'polar wind', called vernal (meaning by the way, a ""p",0.302983500466536,0.25316455198626037,0.19065902239448754

Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of
galactic disk evolution. We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvby
photometry into Te, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss
the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstrom et al. 2004; GCS) in

  We substantially improve the Te and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars,

  The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with
closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains
almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (sigma intrinsic = 0.20
dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life;
specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V
velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning
thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters
for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

with boundaries, studying the non-equilibrium dynamics including fluctuation
effects. The short time dynamics is dominated by superradiance, while the long

state in the finite lattice is not unique, and can be understood in terms of
coherent bosonic excitations above a Fermi surface in real space.

experimentally the applicability of this technique by performing two
dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments on a two

Signatures of an Emergent Gravity from Black Hole Entropy,"  The existence of a thermodynamic description of horizons indicates that
spacetime has a microstructure. While the ""fundamental"" degrees of freedom
remain elusive, quantizing Einstein's gravity provides some clues about their
properties. A quantum AdS black hole possesses an equispaced mass spectrum,
independent of Newton's constant, $G$, when its horizon radius is large
compared to the AdS length. Moreover, the black hole's thermodynamics in this
limit is inextricably connected with its thermodynamics in the opposite
(Schwarzschild) limit by a duality of the Bose partition function. $G$, absent
in the mass spectrum, reemerges in the thermodynamic description through the

The Asymptotic Capacity of the Optical Fiber,"  It is shown that signal energy is the only available degree-of-freedom (DOF)
for fiber-optic transmission as the input power tends to infinity. With $n$
signal DOFs at the input, $n-1$ DOFs are asymptotically lost to signal-noise
interactions. The main observation is that, nonlinearity introduces a
multiplicative noise in the channel, similar to fading in wireless channels.
The channel is viewed in the spherical coordinate system, where signal vector
$\underline{X}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ is represented in terms of its norm
$|\underline{X}|$ and direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$. The multiplicative noise
causes signal direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$ to vary randomly on the surface
of the unit $(2n-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, in such a way that the
effective area of the support of $\underline{\hat{X}}$ does not vanish as
$|\underline{X}|\rightarrow\infty$. On the other hand, the surface area of the
sphere is finite, so that $\underline{\hat{X}}$ carries finite information.
This observation is used to show several results. Firstly, let $\mathcal
C(\mathcal P)$ be the capacity of a discrete-time periodic model of the optical
fiber with distributed noise and frequency-dependent loss, as a function of the
average input power $\mathcal P$. It is shown that asymptotically as $\mathcal
P\rightarrow\infty$, $\mathcal C=\frac{1}{n}\log\bigl(\log\mathcal P\bigr)+c$,
where $n$ is the dimension of the input signal space and $c$ is a bounded
number. In particular, $\lim_{\mathcal P\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal C(\mathcal
P)=\infty$ in finite-dimensional periodic models. Secondly, it is shown that
capacity saturates to a constant in infinite-dimensional models where
$n=\infty$.
","The Asymptotic Capacity of the Optical Fiber (OFL) is also known to be increased after treatment with ultraviolet light, the primary emission source in light sources that can't penetrate the skin's barrier to absorb infrared light. In addition, ozone or ultraviolet OOR light can cause a small amount of visible light in the body — in our eyes, for example, and sometimes in certain areas of our skin. Since ultraviolet D-rays can penetrate a human body's UV-visible surface and the OFL is not visible in that area, it can be called as a ""normal"" O-ray on our eyeballs and skin or, in some cases, on the retina.

"On the 'snow-plow' phase of supernovae interacting with dense
  circumstellar media","  Recently, Moriya et al. (2013) developed an analytic bolometric light curve
model for supernovae interacting with dense circumstellar media. Because of the
dense circumstellar medium, the shocked region is assumed to be radiative and
make a thin dense shell. The model is based on the conservation of momentum in
the shocked dense shell. However, the analytic model was mentioned to neglect
the 'snow-plow' phase of the shocked dense shell by Ofek et al. (2014). The
'snow-plow' or momentum-conserving phase refers to the period in which the
momentum injection from the supernova ejecta is almost terminated and the
radiative shocked dense shell keeps moving due only to the momentum previously
provided by the supernova ejecta. In this Note, I clarify that the analytic
model of Moriya et al. (2013) does take the 'snow-plow' phase into account and
the criticism of Ofek et al. (2014) is incorrect. In addition, Ofek et al.
(2014) related the sudden luminosity break observed in the light curve of Type
IIn SN 2010jl to the transition to the 'snow-plow' phase. However, I argue that
the sudden transition to the 'snow-plow' phase is not consistent with the
luminosity break observed in SN 2010jl. The luminosity break is likely to be
related to other phenomena like the dense shell exiting the dense part of the
circumstellar medium.
","On the'snow-plow' phase of supernovae interacting with dense
  circumstellar media, there are three types:'supernovæ','spaceships', and supernova. In them, the large amount of gas present can be inferred. Supernovas are large stars that are highly elliptical, producing bright-green gas at the center. They are usually the oldest star in the sky and are often called stars because of their close to one and their high mass. One of the most striking features of stars is their star masses. The size of any star may influence the speed of its movement. Therefore, it must be calculated by some basic calculation such as the maximum mass of a star. We are looking at a small number of such stars and the general number and how they are located within the superconductor and in dense  the stellar debris. There are only a relatively few such explosions when found in clusters. A simple technique is to look in    the   a the direction the particle is facing towards the source of radiation, e",0.21178534876502716,0.19230768731185297,0.16618448002268435
"Effective temperatures of a driven, strongly anisotropic Brownian system","  We use Brownian Dynamics computer simulations of a moderately dense colloidal
system undergoing steady shear flow to investigate the uniqueness of the
so-called effective temperature. We compare effective temperatures calculated
from the fluctuation-dissipation ratios and from the linear response to a
static, long wavelength, external perturbation along two directions: the shear
gradient direction and the vorticity direction. At high shear rates, when the
system is strongly anisotropic, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio derived
effective temperatures are approximately wave-vector independent, but the
temperatures along the gradient direction are somewhat higher than those along
the vorticity direction. The temperatures derived from the static linear
response show the same dependence on the direction as those derived from the
fluctuation-dissipation ratio. However, the former and the latter temperatures
are different. Our results suggest that the presently used formulae for
effective temperatures may not be applicable for strongly anisotropic, driven
systems.

"Decomposition of Unitary Matrices for Finding Quantum Circuits:
  Application to Molecular Hamiltonians","  Constructing appropriate unitary matrix operators for new quantum algorithms
and finding the minimum cost gate sequences for the implementation of these
unitary operators is of fundamental importance in the field of quantum
information and quantum computation. Evolution of quantum circuits faces two
major challenges: complex and huge search space and the high costs of
simulating quantum circuits on classical computers. Here, we use the group
leaders optimization algorithm to decompose a given unitary matrix into a
proper-minimum cost quantum gate sequence. We test the method on the known
decompositions of Toffoli gate, the amplification step of the Grover search
algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the sender part of the quantum
teleportation. Using this procedure, we present the circuit designs for the
simulation of the unitary propagators of the Hamiltonians for the hydrogen and
the water molecules. The approach is general and can be applied to generate the

Four moments theorems on Markov chaos,"  We obtain quantitative Four Moments Theorems establishing convergence of the
laws of elements of a Markov chaos to a Pearson distribution, where the only
assumption we make on the Pearson distribution is that it admits four moments.
While in general one cannot use moments to establish convergence to a
heavy-tailed distributions, we provide a context in which only the first four
moments suffices. These results are obtained by proving a general carr\'e du
champ bound on the distance between laws of random variables in the domain of a

The synthesis of Ti44 and Ni56 in massive stars,"  We discuss the influence of rotation on the combined synthesis of Ti44 and
Ni56 in massive stars. While Ni56 is significantly produced by both the
complete and incomplete explosive Si burning, Ti44 is mainly produced by the
complete explosive Si burning, with a minor contribution (in standard non
rotating models) from the incomplete explosive Si burning and the O burning
(both explosive and hydrostatic). We find that, in most cases, the thickness of
the region exposed to the incomplete explosive Si burning increases in rotating
models (v_ini=300 km/s) and since Ni56 is significantly produced in this zone,
the fraction of mass coming from the complete explosive Si burning zone,
necessary to get the required amount of Ni56, reduces. Therefore the amount of
Ti44 ejected for a given fixed amount of Ni56 decreases in rotating models.
However, some rotating models at [Fe/H]=-1 develop a very extended O convective
shell in which a consistent amount of Ti44 is formed, preserved and ejected in
the interstellar medium. Hence a better modeling of the thermal instabilities
(convection) in the advanced burning phases together with a critical analysis
of the cross sections of the nuclear reactions operating in O burning are
relevant for the understanding of the synthesis of Ti44.
","The synthesis of Ti44 and Ni56 in massive stars was by means of a large nuclear fusion machine. But because of their low energy, it proved problematic for calculations involving stars that are smaller than usgs, such as H.S. Hinton, who proved the energy difference between H 2 and H 3 by the electron and the neutrino collision, respectively.

""It's the fusion of two neutron stars to create a supernova,"" says C. S. Green of Penn State, author of the study. ""They're both large neutron star binaries but only about 9.9 times less massive than Higgs bosons. We have a really good proof of that supernovae.

Magneto-optics of massive Dirac fermions in bulk Bi2Se3,"  We report on magneto-optical studies of Bi2Se3, a representative member of
the 3D topological insulator family. Its electronic states in bulk are shown to
be well described by a simple Dirac-type Hamiltonian for massive particles with
only two parameters: the fundamental bandgap and the band velocity. In a
magnetic field, this model implies a unique property - spin splitting equal to
twice the cyclotron energy: Es = 2Ec. This explains the extensive
magneto-transport studies concluding a fortuitous degeneracy of the spin and
orbital split Landau levels in this material. The Es = 2Ec match differentiates
the massive Dirac electrons in bulk Bi2Se3 from those in quantum
electrodynamics, for which Es = Ec always holds.

BPP: Large Graph Storage for Efficient Disk Based Processing,"  Processing very large graphs like social networks, biological and chemical
compounds is a challenging task. Distributed graph processing systems process
the billion-scale graphs efficiently but incur overheads of efficient
partitioning and distribution of the graph over a cluster of nodes. Distributed
processing also requires cluster management and fault tolerance. In order to
overcome these problems GraphChi was proposed recently. GraphChi significantly
outperformed all the representative distributed processing frameworks. Still,
we observe that GraphChi incurs some serious degradation in performance due to
1) high number of non-sequential I/Os for processing every chunk of graph; and
2) lack of true parallelism to process the graph. In this paper we propose a
simple yet powerful engine BiShard Parallel Processor (BPP) to efficiently
process billions-scale graphs on a single PC. We extend the storage structure
proposed by GraphChi and introduce a new processing model called BiShard
Parallel (BP). BP enables full CPU parallelism for processing the graph and
significantly reduces the number of non-sequential I/Os required to process
every chunk of the graph. Our experiments on real large graphs show that our
solution significantly outperforms GraphChi.

"The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury XVII. Examining Obscured Star
  Formation with Synthetic Ultraviolet Flux Maps in M31","  We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet (FUV and NUV) maps of M31,
both with and without dust reddening. These maps were constructed from
spatially-resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble
Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling
to generate synthetic UV maps with projected spatial resolution of $\sim$100 pc
($\sim$24 arcseconds) The predicted UV flux agrees well with the observed flux,
with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of
$\log_{10}(f^{syn}/f^{obs}) = 0.03\pm0.24$ and $-0.03\pm0.16$ in the FUV and
NUV, respectively. This agreement is particularly impressive given that we used
only optical photometry to construct these UV maps. We use the dust-free maps
to examine properties of obscured flux and star formation by comparing our
reddened and dust-free FUV flux maps with the observed FUV and FUV+24{\mu}m
flux to examine the fraction of obscured flux. The synthetic flux maps require
that $\sim$90% of the FUV flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the
GALEX-based methods suggest that $\sim$70% of the flux is obscured. This
increase in the obscured flux estimate is driven by significant differences
between the dust-free synthetic FUV flux and that derived when correcting the
observed FUV for dust with 24{\mu}m observations. The difference is further
illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the FUV+24{\mu}m flux with
the 100 Myr average SFR from the SFHs. The 24{\mu}m-corrected FUV flux
underestimates the SFR by a factor of $\sim$2.3 - 2.5. [abridged]

"Probing the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the
  photoelectric heating within photodissociation regions","  We observationally investigate the relation between the photoelectric heating
efficiency in PDRs and the charge of PAHs, which are considered to play a key
role in photoelectric heating. Using PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six
PDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_0=100-10^5). To measure
the photoelectric heating efficiency, we obtained the intensities of the main
cooling lines, i.e., the [OI]63um, 145um, and [CII]158um, as well as the FIR
continuum intensity. We used Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to
investigate the MIR PAH features in the same regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH
emission into that of neutral (PAH^0) and positively ionized (PAH^+) species to
derive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the
photoelectric heating efficiency. The heating efficiency traced by
([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) / TIR, ranges between 0.1% and 0.9% in
different sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^0 + PAH^+) spans
from 0(+11)% to 87(+/-10)%. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low
heating efficiency, and all positions with a high heating efficiency have a low
PAH^+ fraction, supporting the scenario in which a positive grain charge
results in a decreased heating efficiency. Theoretical estimates of the
photoelectric heating efficiency show a stronger dependence on the charging
parameter gamma=G_0 T^{1/2}/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this
study, and the discrepancy is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric
heating efficiency on PAHs, traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) /
(PAH+[OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um), shows a much better match between the
observations and the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the
photoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs with a theoretical model indicates the
dominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating. (abridged for

Bose-Einstein condensation of a Knudsen gas,"  We reconcile a long-standing controversy regarding the transition temperature
of the Bose-Einstein condensation in a dilute interacting Bose gas, by showing
that there is a crossover between ideal gas and interacting gas. The former
corresponds to a Knudsen (or collisionless) regime, in which the mean-free-path
is much larger than the system dimension, while the latter corresponds to the
opposite hydrodynamic regime. The deviation of the transition temperature from
that of the non-interacting gas is proportional to the square root of a in the

length. This crossover may be observable in a Bose gas trapped in a potential

"Hybrid magic state distillation for universal fault-tolerant quantum
  computation","  A set of stabilizer operations augmented by some special initial states known
as 'magic states', gives the possibility of universal fault-tolerant quantum
computation. However, magic state preparation inevitably involves nonideal
operations that introduce noise. The most common method to eliminate the noise
is magic state distillation (MSD) by stabilizer operations. Here we propose a
hybrid MSD protocol by connecting a four-qubit H-type MSD with a five-qubit
T-type MSD, in order to overcome some disadvantages of the previous MSD
protocols. The hybrid MSD protocol further integrates distillable ranges of
different existing MSD protocols and extends the T-type distillable range to
the stabilizer octahedron edges. And it provides considerable improvement in
qubit cost for almost all of the distillable range. Moreover, we experimentally
demonstrate the four-qubit H-type MSD protocol using nuclear magnetic resonance
technology, together with the previous five-qubit MSD experiment, to show the
feasibility of the hybrid MSD protocol.

analysis of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hillard models, we investigate the potential
problems of using partially implicit schemes, demonstrate the importance of
using fully implicit schemes and discuss the limitation of energy stability
that are often used to evaluate the quality of a numerical scheme for
phase-field modeling. In particular, we make the following observations: 1. a
convex splitting scheme (CSS in short) can be equivalent to some fully implicit
scheme (FIS in short) with a much different time scaling and thus it may lack
numerical accuracy; 2. most implicit schemes (in discussions) are energy-stable
if the time-step size is sufficiently small; 3. a traditionally known
conditionally energy-stable scheme still possess an unconditionally
energy-stable physical solution; 4. an unconditionally energy-stable scheme is
not necessarily better than a conditionally energy-stable scheme when the time
step size is not small enough; 5. a first-order FIS for the Allen-Cahn model

level and hence the discrete phase variable satisfies $|u_h(x)|\le 1$ for all
$x$ and, furthermore, the linearized discretized system can be effectively
preconditioned by discrete Poisson operators.

Ellipsoidal cones in normed vector spaces,"  We give two characterizations of cones over ellipsoids in real normed vector
spaces. Let $C$ be a closed convex cone with nonempty interior such that $C$
has a bounded section of codimension $1$. We show that $C$ is a cone over an
ellipsoid if and only if every bounded section of $C$ has a center of symmetry.
We also show that $C$ is a cone over an ellipsoid if and only if the affine
span of $\partial C \cap \partial(a - C)$ has codimension $1$ for every point
$a$ in the interior of $C$. These results generalize the finite-dimensional
cases proved in (Jer\'onimo-Castro and McAllister, 2013).

Mechanics of disordered auxetic metamaterials,"  Auxetic materials are of great engineering interest not only because of their
fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to their increased toughness
and indentation resistance. These materials are typically synthesized polyester
foams with a very heterogeneous structure, but the role of disorder in auxetic
behavior is not fully understood. Here, we provide a systematic theoretical and
experimental investigation in to the effect of disorder on the mechanical
properties of a paradigmatic auxetic lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal
geometry. We show that disorder has a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio
unless the lattice topology is altered, and in all cases examined the disorder
preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of loading
applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or ductile failure
is observed. It is found that brittle failure is associated with a
disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in ductile failure disorder does
not affect strength. Our work thus provides general guidelines to optimize
elasticity and strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.
","Mechanics of disordered auxetic metamaterials is not the same as the formation of dissimilar systems in complex organics that are more similar than the structure or composition of the whole system. This is because there are at least two mechanisms whereby different systems may be formed on the atomic-scale at different times, for example, with the addition of a membrane membrane. The mechanism is very precise, though a lot of it still needs to be studied in order to fully understand how dissociable and dissociated dissides arise through different processes.

Finally, many of these ""chemical"" ideas are also related to dissociation and a very large amount of their application to the life. For example two very interesting things happened one spring, and another fall of this same spring. We are here to argue that",0.27442452769632464,0.20792078709146175,0.20438252238324672

systems show remarkable analogies. The topics reviewed include the structure of
the finite rotating many-body state, universality of vortex formation and
localization of vortices in both bosonic and fermionic systems, and the
emergence of particle-vortex composites in the quantum Hall regime. An overview
of the computational many-body techniques sets focus on the configuration

However the quantum systems can never interact at the level specified, and so the same fundamental system cannot be achieved.

"Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Object Detection with

Applications of the Likelihood Theory in Finance: Modelling and Pricing,"  This paper discusses the connection between mathematical finance and
statistical modelling which turns out to be more than a formal mathematical
correspondence. We like to figure out how common results and notions in
statistics and their meaning can be translated to the world of mathematical
finance and vice versa. A lot of similarities can be expressed in terms of
LeCam's theory for statistical experiments which is the theory of the behaviour
of likelihood processes. For positive prices the arbitrage free financial
assets fit into filtered experiments. It is shown that they are given by
filtered likelihood ratio processes. From the statistical point of view,
martingale measures, completeness and pricing formulas are revisited. The
pricing formulas for various options are connected with the power functions of
tests. For instance the Black-Scholes price of a European option has an
interpretation as Bayes risk of a Neyman Pearson test. Under contiguity the
convergence of financial experiments and option prices are obtained. In
particular, the approximation of Ito type price processes by discrete models
and the convergence of associated option prices is studied. The result relies
on the central limit theorem for statistical experiments, which is well known
in statistics in connection with local asymptotic normal (LAN) families. As
application certain continuous time option prices can be approximated by
related discrete time pricing formulas.
","Applications of the Likelihood Theory in Finance: Modelling and Pricing The empirical proof was based on a few mathematical techniques that involved estimation of expected returns on an index based upon the real returns of an asset over time (referred to hereafter as ""Real Return Theory"") (see Theorem, The Real Return-Theorem and The Rulers and Price Revolution ). The basic formula for expected return was R = R + A(x) where E = x + E + 2 + 1 = E in general, and A in mathematical terms. The model was applied at A and B, respectively. In our case the model is the R1 (the expected marginal return) model and, as we know, any of L and R2. But here one of A's equations has two properties: it is a perfect approximation to the standard test and the actual return is known by simple arithmetic. (It has been shown in a previous paper that R cannot be expressed using the 'F/O' notation and therefore therefore has an effective exponent.)

Cost-Sensitive Label Embedding for Multi-Label Classification,"  Label embedding (LE) is an important family of multi-label classification
algorithms that digest the label information jointly for better performance.
Different real-world applications evaluate performance by different cost
functions of interest. Current LE algorithms often aim to optimize one specific
cost function, but they can suffer from bad performance with respect to other
cost functions. In this paper, we resolve the performance issue by proposing a
novel cost-sensitive LE algorithm that takes the cost function of interest into
account. The proposed algorithm, cost-sensitive label embedding with
multidimensional scaling (CLEMS), approximates the cost information with the
distances of the embedded vectors by using the classic multidimensional scaling
approach for manifold learning. CLEMS is able to deal with both symmetric and
asymmetric cost functions, and effectively makes cost-sensitive decisions by
nearest-neighbor decoding within the embedded vectors. We derive theoretical
results that justify how CLEMS achieves the desired cost-sensitivity.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that CLEMS is
significantly better than a wide spectrum of existing LE algorithms and
state-of-the-art cost-sensitive algorithms across different cost functions.

"Rips filtrations for quasi-metric spaces and asymmetric functions with
  stability results","  The Rips filtration over a finite metric space and its corresponding
persistent homology are prominent methods in TDA to summarise the shape of
data. Crucial to their use is the bottleneck stability result. A generalisation
of the Rips filtration to any symmetric function $f:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$
was defined by Chazal, De Silva and Oudot, and they showed it was stable with
respect to the correspondence distortion distance. Allowing asymmetry, we
consider four different persistence modules. The first method is through
symmetrisation. For $a\in [0,1]$ we can construct a symmetric function
$sym_a(f)(x,y)=a \min \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}+ (1-a)\max \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}$. We can
then follow the apply the standard theory for symmetric functions and get
stability as a corollary. The second method is to construct a filtration of
ordered tuple complexes where tuple $(x_0, x_2, \ldots x_p)\in Rips^{dir}(X)_t$
if $d(x_i, x_j)\leq t$ for all $i\leq j$. These two methods have the same
persistent homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric
space, or more generally to a symmetric function. We consider two constructions
using a filtration of directed graphs. We have directed graphs $\{D(X)_t\}$,
where directed edges $x\to y$ are included in $D(X)_t$ whenever
$\max\{f(x,y),f(x,x),f(y,y)\}\leq t$. From this we construct a preorder where
$x\leq y$ if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D(X)_t$. We build persistence
modules using the strongly connected components of the graphs $D(X)_t$, which
are the equivalence classes of the associated preorders. We consider
persistence modules using a generalisation of poset topology to preorders. The
Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be extended as a correspondence distortion
distance to set-function pairs. We prove that all these new constructions enjoy
the same stability results.

A momentum-space Argonne V18 interaction,"  This paper gives a momentum-space representation of the Argonne V18 potential

practical and efficient representations for computing the momentum-space
potential that do not require integration or interpolation. Programs based on
both expansions are available as supplementary material. Analytic expressions
are given for the scalar coefficient functions of the Fourier transform of the

First, the large orbital resolution of such a model necessitates that we must obtain a good approximation to the size and speed of the planet from a detailed mapping of both the gravitational waves being exchanged and those being emitted from its surface, rather than a more simplified model of an orbit. Second, most of our planet's atmosphere is in some part water. This means that it is a large fraction of its temperature. There is also something going on, however, in our own orbital environment: water molecules in the atmosphere are rapidly flowing out of each other into other molecules.

21cm fluctuations from primordial magnetic fields,"  Recent observations of magnetic fields in intergalactic void regions and in
high redshift galaxies may indicate that large scale magnetic fields have a
primordial origin. If primordial magnetic fields were present soon after the
recombination epoch, they would have induced density fluctuations on the one
hand and dissipated their energy into the primordial gas on the other, and
thereby significantly alter the thermal history of the Universe. Here we
consider both the effects and calculate the brightness temperature fluctuations
of the 21cm line using simple Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the
fluctuations of the 21cm line from the energy dissipation appear only on very
small scales and those from the density fluctuations always dominate on
observationally relevant angular scales.

Abstract
. The authors searched for active galactic microwave sources through high-dimensional space in clusters of high frequency stellar star systems, which consist of stars, galaxies, supernova remnants, stars-forming regions, and other types of exoplanetary materials, as well as interplanetary or cometary exovae. They estimated the number of objects detected by microwave imaging of four clusters (1, 2, 3, 4) to be less than 3 million per year (i.e., about one billion stars per day). This finding is significant because as fast-and as-well as distant galactic centers and the expansion of our solar system are expected to expand as the rate of change of the star's masses increases, a critical step is needed to determine if there are many",0.20095463452615303,0.13100436183367994,0.17698147416221002

circular in shape, has a radial density decline well described by a power law
of index $\gamma = -2.2 \pm 0.2$, and contains approximately $1.6\%$ of the

Vesper: Using Echo-Analysis to Detect Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in LANs,"  The Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a cyber-attack in which an attacker
intercepts traffic, thus harming the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the network. It remains a popular attack vector due to its
simplicity. However, existing solutions are either not portable, suffer from a
high false positive rate, or are simply not generic. In this paper, we propose
Vesper: a novel plug-and-play MitM detector for local area networks. Vesper
uses a technique inspired from impulse response analysis used in the domain of
acoustic signal processing. Analogous to how echoes in a cave capture the shape
and construction of the environment, so to can a short and intense pulse of
ICMP echo requests model the link between two network hosts. Vesper uses neural
networks called autoencoders to model the normal patterns of the echoed pulses,
and detect when the environment changes. Using this technique, Vesper is able
to detect MitM attacks with high accuracy while incurring minimal network
overhead. We evaluate Vesper on LANs consisting of video surveillance cameras,
servers, and PC workstations. We also investigate several possible adversarial
attacks against Vesper, and demonstrate how Vesper mitigates these attacks.

"Comparative Analysis of Brookhaven National Laboratory Nuclear Decay
  Data and Super-Kamiokande Neutrino Data: Indication of a Solar Connection","  An experiment carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory from February
1982 to December 1989 acquired 364 measurements of the beta-decay rates of a
sample of 36Cl and of a sample of 32Si. The experimenters reported finding
small periodic annual deviations of the data points from an exponential decay -
of uncertain origin. We here analyze this dataset by power spectrum analysis
and by forming spectrograms and phasegrams. We confirm the occurrence of annual
oscillations but we also find evidence of oscillations in a band of frequencies
appropriate for the internal rotation of the Sun. Both datasets show clear
evidence of a transient oscillation with a frequency of 12.7 cycles per year
that falls in the range of rotational frequencies for the solar radiative zone.
We repeat these analyses for 358 neutrino measurements acquired by
Super-Kamiokande over the interval May 1986 to August 2001. Spectrogram
analysis yields a strong and steady oscillation at about 9.5 cycles per year
and an intermittent oscillation with frequency in the range 12.5 - 12.7 cycles
per year. We attribute the former to rotation of the solar core and the latter
to rotation in the radiative zone. Since the flux of neutrinos (8B neutrinos)
responsible for the Super-Kamiokande measurements is known, we are able to
estimate the cross sections for the beta-decay oscillations at 12.7 cycles per
year. These estimates are found to be 10-21.6 cm-2 for 36Cl and 10-18.4 cm-2
for 32Si. We suggest that the beta-decay process is influenced by neutrinos,
and that the solar neutrino flux is modulated by magnetic field in the deep
solar interior by Resonant Spin Flavor Precession.

that magnetic ordering in bulk is not driven by the spin fluctuation and should
be instead explained as ordering of localized moments. This picture changes for
low-dimensional heterostructures, where the charge fluctuation is suppressed
and overtaken by the enhanced spin instability, which results in a

respect to the introduced product, and is called isounit. We construct
isotopies in both associative and non-associative arbitrary algebras, and
examples of these constructions are exhibited using Clifford algebras, which
although associative, can generate the octonionic, non-associative, algebra.
The whole formalism is developed in a Clifford algebraic arena, giving also the
necessary pre-requisites to introduce isotopies of the exterior algebra. The
flavor hadronic symmetry of the six u,d,s,c,b,t quarks is shown to be exact,
when the generators of the isotopic Lie algebra su(6) are constructed, and the
unit of the isotopic Clifford algebra is shown to be a function of the six
quark masses. The limits constraining the parameters, that are entries of the
representation of the isounit in the isotopic group SU(6), are based on the
most recent limits imposed on quark masses.

"Giant isochoric compressibility of solid Helium-4: the bistability of
  superlcimbing dislocations","  A significant accumulation of matter in solid Helium-4 observed during the
superflow events, dubbed as the giant isochoric compressibility (or the syringe
effect), is discussed within the model of dislocations with superfluid core. It
is shown that solid Helium-4 in a contact with superfluid reservoir can develop
a bistability with respect to the syringe fraction, with the threshold for the
bias by chemical potential determined by a typical free length of dislocations
with superfluid core. The main implications of this effect are: hysteresis and
strongly non-linear dynamical behavior leading to growth, proliferation and
possibly exiting from a crystal of superclimbing dislocations. Three major
channels for such dynamics are identified: i) injection and inflation of the
prismatic loops from the boundary; ii) Bardeed-Herring generation of the loops
in the bulk; iii) helical instability of the screw dislocations. It is argued
that the current experiments are likely to be well in this regime. Several
testable predictions for the time and the bias dependencies of the dynamics are
suggested

Geometric inequalities for axially symmetric black holes,"  A geometric inequality in General Relativity relates quantities that have
both a physical interpretation and a geometrical definition. It is well known
that the parameters that characterize the Kerr-Newman black hole satisfy
several important geometric inequalities. Remarkably enough, some of these
inequalities also hold for dynamical black holes. This kind of inequalities
play an important role in the characterization of the gravitational collapse,
they are closed related with the cosmic censorship conjecture. Axially
symmetric black holes are the natural candidates to study these inequalities
because the quasi-local angular momentum is well defined for them. We review
recent results in this subject and we also describe the main ideas behind the
proofs. Finally, a list of relevant open problem is presented.
","Geometric inequalities for axially symmetric black holes, as we saw above, which result mostly in an asymmetric hole of any size, are shown.

A hierarchical loss and its problems when classifying non-hierarchically,"  Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse
and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle;
after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing
metrics of failure (so-called ""loss"" or ""win"") used in textual or visual
classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori
information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a
skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed
possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any
given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a
classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called
ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from
the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the
standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent
with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as
much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize
the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as
an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to
minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful
metric of success of a classifier.
","A hierarchical loss and its problems when classifying non-hierarchically distributed resources is a problem.

"Dark matter inner slope and concentration in galaxies: from the Fornax
  dwarf to M87","  We apply two new state-of-the-art methods that model the distribution of
observed tracers in projected phase space to lift the mass / velocity
anisotropy (VA) degeneracy and deduce constraints on the mass profiles of
galaxies, as well as their VA. We first show how a distribution function based
method applied to the satellite kinematics of otherwise isolated SDSS galaxies
shows convincing observational evidence of age matching: red galaxies have more
concentrated dark matter (DM) halos than blue galaxies of the same stellar or
halo mass. Then, applying the MAMPOSSt technique to M87 (traced by its red and
blue globular clusters) we find that very cuspy DM is favored, unless we
release priors on DM concentration or stellar mass (leading to unconstrained
slope). For the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (traced by its metal-rich and
metal-poor stars), the inner DM slope is unconstrained, with weak evidence for
a core if the stellar mass is fixed. This highlights how priors are crucial for
DM modeling. Finally, we find that blue GCs around M87 and metal-rich stars in
Fornax have tangential outer VA.

The Neutron Electric Dipole Moment and Probe of PeV Scale Physics,"  The experimental limit on the neutron electric dipole moment is used as a
possible probe of new physics beyond the standard model. Within MSSM we use the
current experimental limit on the neutron EDM and possible future improvement
as a probe of high scale SUSY. Quantitative analyses show that scalar masses as
large as a PeV and larger could be probed in improved experiment far above the
scales accessible at future colliders. We also discuss the neutron EDM as a
probe of new physics models beyond MSSM. Specifically we consider an MSSM
extension with a particle content including a vectorlike multiplet. Such an
extension brings in new sources of CP violation beyond those in MSSM. These CP
phases contribute to the EDM of the quarks and to the neutron EDM. These
contributions are analyzed in this work where we include the supersymmetric
loop diagrams involving the neutralinos, charginos, the gluino, squark and
mirror squark exchange diagrams at the one loop level. We also take into
account the contributions from the $W$, $Z$, quark and mirror quark exchanges
arising from the mixings of the vectorlike generation with the three
generations. It is shown that the experimental limit on the neutron EDM can be
used to probe such new physics models. In the future one expects the neutron
EDM to improve an order of magnitude or more allowing one to extend the probe
of high scale SUSY and of new physics models. For the MSSM the probe of high
scales could go up to and beyond PeV scale masses.

The Taurid complex meteor showers and asteroids,"  The structure of the Taurid meteor complex based on photographic orbits
available in the IAU Meteor database is studied. We have searched for potential
sub-streams or filaments to be associated with the complex utilizing the
Southworth-Hawkins D-criterion. Applying a strict limiting value for D=0.10,
fifteen sub-streams or filaments, consisting of more than three members, could
be separated out from the general complex. To confirm their mutual consistence
as filaments, rather than fortuitous clumping at the present time, the orbital
evolution over 5000 years of each member is studied. Utilizing the D-criterion
we also searched for NEOs that might be associated with the streams and
filaments of the complex and investigated the orbital evolution of potential
members. Possible associations between 7 Taurid filaments and 9 NEOs were
found. The most probable are for S Psc(b) -- 2003QC10, N Tau(a) -- 2004TG10, o

"Blocking Transferability of Adversarial Examples in Black-Box Learning
  Systems","  Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral
component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and
driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services
offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service
tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the
classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that
adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another
classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different
architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is
known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box
systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and
transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to
protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block
their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the
input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on
the original label and instead predicts that the input is ""invalid"". In
essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the
classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In
experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on
the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed
method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining
the accuracy on clean data.

Transits of extrasolar moons around luminous giant planets,"  Beyond Earth-like planets, moons can be habitable, too. No exomoons have been

Transits of their moons might be detectable in their infrared photometric light
curves if the planets are sufficiently separated ($\gtrsim10$ AU) from the
stars to be directly imaged. The moons will be heated by radiation from their
young planets and potentially by tidal friction. Although stellar illumination
will be weak beyond 5 AU, these alternative energy sources could liquify

"Shift operators, residue families and degenerate Laplacians","  We introduce new aspects in conformal geometry of some very natural
second-order differential operators. These operators are termed shift
operators. In the flat space, they are intertwining operators which are closely
related to symmetry breaking differential operators. In the curved case, they
are closely connected with ideas of holography and the works of
Fefferman-Graham, Gover-Waldron and one of the authors. In particular, we
obtain an alternative description of the so-called residue families in
conformal geometry in terms of compositions of shift operators. This relation
allows easy new proofs of some of their basic properties. In addition, we
derive new holographic formulas for $Q$-curvatures in even dimension. Since
these turn out to be equivalent to earlier holographic formulas, the novelty
here is their conceptually very natural proof. The overall discussion leads to
a unification of constructions in representation theory and conformal geometry.

Stability of localized modes in PT-symmetric nonlinear potentials,"  We report on detailed investigation of the stability of localized modes in
the nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a nonlinear parity-time (alias PT)
symmetric potential. We are particularly focusing on the case where the
spatially-dependent nonlinearity is purely imaginary. We compute the Evans
function of the linear operator determining the linear stability of localized
modes. Results of the Evans function analysis predict that for sufficiently
small dissipation localized modes become stable when the propagation constant
exceeds certain threshold value. This is the case for periodic and
$\tanh$-shaped complex potentials where the modes having widths comparable with
or smaller than the characteristic width of the complex potential are stable,
while broad modes are unstable. In contrast, in complex potentials that change
linearly with transverse coordinate all modes are stable, what suggests that
the relation between width of the modes and spatial size of the complex
potential define the stability in the general case. These results were
confirmed using the direct propagation of the solutions for the mentioned
examples.
","Stability of localized modes in PT-symmetric nonlinear potentials is generally considered less significant than in linear potential parameters. The latter condition can be considered as a predictor of the relative resolution of any given nonlocalization function between parallel states. For the most part, the effect of parallel state can also be attributed to the absence of an apparent parallel-state distribution in both parallel and non-localized modes; though, some recent studies provide data that argue for the fact that there is a correlation between the two states.[22] For instance, a small study published in 2016 concluded that the ability of PD is limited by the strength of a parallelized mode to achieve at least a 0.5 AU gap in the linear path (see Figure 3, below, for details).

Deterministic aspects of nonlinear modulation instability,"  Different from statistical considerations on stochastic wave fields, this
paper aims to contribute to the understanding of (some of) the underlying
physical phenomena that may give rise to the occurrence of extreme, rogue,

develops extreme waves from a uniform background. For this explicitly described
nonlinear extension of the Benjamin-Feir instability, the soliton on finite
background of the NLS equation, the global down-stream evolving distortions,
the time signal of the extreme waves, and the local evolution near the extreme
position are investigated. As part of the search for conditions to obtain

property for the physical energy, and comment on the possible validity for more

Quantized Memory-Augmented Neural Networks,"  Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) refer to a class of neural network
models equipped with external memory (such as neural Turing machines and memory
networks). These neural networks outperform conventional recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) in terms of learning long-term dependency, allowing them to
solve intriguing AI tasks that would otherwise be hard to address. This paper
concerns the problem of quantizing MANNs. Quantization is known to be effective
when we deploy deep models on embedded systems with limited resources.
Furthermore, quantization can substantially reduce the energy consumption of
the inference procedure. These benefits justify recent developments of
quantized multi layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and RNNs. However,
no prior work has reported the successful quantization of MANNs. The in-depth
analysis presented here reveals various challenges that do not appear in the
quantization of the other networks. Without addressing them properly, quantized
MANNs would normally suffer from excessive quantization error which leads to
degraded performance. In this paper, we identify memory addressing
(specifically, content-based addressing) as the main reason for the performance
degradation and propose a robust quantization method for MANNs to address the
challenge. In our experiments, we achieved a computation-energy gain of 22x
with 8-bit fixed-point and binary quantization compared to the floating-point
implementation. Measured on the bAbI dataset, the resulting model, named the
quantized MANN (Q-MANN), improved the error rate by 46% and 30% with 8-bit
fixed-point and binary quantization, respectively, compared to the MANN

Abstract
 … in fact, the 'higgs boson' is in this sense 'bordered' - it is a singular particle that can interact with all dimensions. However, it seems to be impossible to control such particles from our conscious mind that we encounter. In short, a super-heuristic 'Higgs Boson', we propose to introduce a more holistic and non-relational model of quantum systems. On the one hand, this model implies that a system can possess quantum states that interact only with other sub-atomic particles. But on a deeper level, on top of this, nonconstrained",0.22607329316744113,0.1921708135920266,0.18680476043910946

Vortical field amplification and particle acceleration at rippled shocks,"  Supernova Remnants (SNRs) shocks are believed to accelerate charged particles
and to generate strong turbulence in the post-shock flow. From high-energy
observations in the past decade, a magnetic field at SNR shocks largely
exceeding the shock-compressed interstellar field has been inferred. We outline
how such a field amplification results from a small-scale dynamo process
downstream of the shock, providing an explicit expression for the turbulence
back-reaction to the fluid whirling. The spatial scale of the $X-$ray rims and
the short time-variability can be obtained by using reasonable parameters for
the interstellar turbulence. We show that such a vortical field saturation is
faster than the acceleration time of the synchrotron emitting energetic
electrons.

"Single electrons from heavy-flavor mesons in relativistic heavy-ion
  collisions","  We study the single electron spectra from $D-$ and $B-$meson semileptonic
decays in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$200, 62.4, and 19.2 GeV by
employing the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that has
been shown to reasonably describe the charm dynamics at RHIC and LHC energies
on a microscopic level. In this approach the initial heavy quarks are produced
by using the PYTHIA which is tuned to reproduce the FONLL calculations. The
produced heavy quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in QGP with
scattering cross sections which are calculated in the dynamical quasi-particle
model (DQPM). At energy densities close to the critical energy density the
heavy quarks are hadronized into heavy mesons through either coalescence or
fragmentation. After hadronization the heavy mesons interact with the light
hadrons by employing the scattering cross sections from an effective
Lagrangian. The final heavy mesons then produce single electrons through
semileptonic decay. We find that the PHSD approach well describes the nuclear
modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ of single electrons in
d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 200 GeV and the elliptic flow
in Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV from the PHENIX
collaboration, however, the large $R_{\rm AA}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV
is not described at all. Furthermore, we make predictions for the $R_{\rm AA}$
of $D-$mesons and of single electrons at the lower energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}=$ 19.2 GeV. Additionally, the medium modification of the azimuthal angle
$\phi$ between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark is studied. We find that the
transverse flow enhances the azimuthal angular distributions close to $\phi=$ 0
because the heavy flavors strongly interact with nuclear medium in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions and almost flow with the bulk matter.

Naming Game on Networks: Let Everyone be Both Speaker and Hearer,"  To investigate how consensus is reached on a large self-organized
peer-to-peer network, we extended the naming game model commonly used in
language and communication to Naming Game in Groups (NGG). Differing from other
existing naming game models, in NGG, everyone in the population (network) can
be both speaker and hearer simultaneously, which resembles in a closer manner
to real-life scenarios. Moreover, NGG allows the transmission (communication)
of multiple words (opinions) for multiple intra-group consensuses. The
communications among indirectly-connected nodes are also enabled in NGG. We
simulated and analyzed the consensus process in some typical network
topologies, including random-graph networks, small-world networks and
scale-free networks, to better understand how global convergence (consensus)
could be reached on one common word. The results are interpreted on group
negotiation of a peer-to-peer network, which shows that global consensus in the
population can be reached more rapidly when more opinions are permitted within
each group or when the negotiating groups in the population are larger in size.
The novel features and properties introduced by our model have demonstrated its
applicability in better investigating general consensus problems on
peer-to-peer networks.

A numerical invariant for linear representations of finite groups,"  We study the notion of essential dimension for a linear representation of a
finite group. In characteristic zero we relate it to the canonical dimension of
certain products of Weil transfers of generalized Severi-Brauer varieties. We
then proceed to compute the canonical dimension of a broad class of varieties
of this type, extending earlier results of the first author. As a consequence,
we prove analogues of classical theorems of R. Brauer and O. Schilling about
the Schur index, where the Schur index of a representation is replaced by its
essential dimension. In the last section we show that essential dimension of
representations can behave in rather unexpected ways in the modular setting.

"Origin of the literature discrepancies in the fractional reduction of
  the apex-field enhancement factor considering small clusters of field
  emitters","  Numerical simulations are important when assessing the many characteristics
of field emission related phenomena. In small simulation domains, the
electrostatic effect from the boundaries is known to influence the calculated
apex field enhancement factor (FEF) of the emitter, but no established
dependence has been reported at present. In this work, we report the dependence
of the lateral size, $L$, and the height, $H$, of the simulation domain on the
apex-FEF of a single conducting ellipsoidal emitter. Firstly, we analyze the
error, $\varepsilon$, in the calculation of the apex-FEF as a function of $H$
and $L$. Importantly, our results show that the effects of $H$ and $L$ on
$\varepsilon$ are scale invariant, allowing one to predict $\varepsilon$ for
ratios $L/h$ and $H/h$, where $h$ is the height of the emitter. Next, we
analyze the fractional change of the apex-FEF, $\delta$, from a single emitter,
$\gamma_1$, and a pair, $\gamma_2$. We show that small relative errors in
$\gamma_1$ (i.e., $\varepsilon\approx0.5\%$), due to the finite domain size,
are sufficient to alter the functional dependence $\delta(c)$, where $c$ is the
distance from the emitters in the pair. We show that $\delta(c)$ obeys a
recently proposed power law decay in the limit of infinite domain size
($\varepsilon=0$, say), in contrast to a long time established exponential
decay. Thus, power law functional dependence, $-\delta \sim c^{-n}$, with
$n=3$, is suggested to be a universal signature of the charge-blunting effect,
at sufficient large distances between similar emitters with any shape. These
results explain the origin of the discrepancies in the literature and improves
the scientific understanding of the field electron emission theory, for
accurate characterization of emitters in small clusters or arrays.

An observational detection of the bridge effect of void filaments,"  The bridge effect of void filaments is a phrase coined by Park & Lee (2009b)
to explain the correlations found in a numerical experiment between the
luminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of their
host filaments. Their numerical finding implies that a straight void filament
provides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matter
particles from the surroundings into the void galaxies. Analyzing the Sloan
void catalog constructed by Pan et al (2012), we identify the filamentary
structures in void regions and determine the specific size of each void
filament as a measure of its straightness. To avoid possible spurious signals
caused by the Malmquist bias, we consider only those void filaments whose
redshifts are in the range of 0=< z <= 0.02 and find a clear tendency that the
void galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average more
luminous, which is in qualitative agreement with the numerical prediction. It
is also shown that the strength of correlation increases with the number of the
member galaxies of the void filaments, which can be physically understood on
the grounds that the more stretched filaments can connect the dense
surroundings even to the galaxies located deep in the central parts of the
voids. This observational evidence may provide a key clue to the puzzling issue
of why the void galaxies have higher specific star formation rates and bluer
colors than their wall counterparts.

"Protein sequestration versus Hill-type repression in circadian clock
  models","  Circadian (~24hr) clocks are self-sustained endogenous oscillators with which
organisms keep track of daily and seasonal time. Circadian clocks frequently
rely on interlocked transcriptional- translational feedback loops to generate
rhythms that are robust against intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. To
investigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the intracellular feedback loops in
circadian clocks, a number of mathematical models have been developed. The
majority of the models use Hill functions to describe transcriptional
repression in a way that is similar to the Goodwin model. Recently, a new class
of models with protein sequestration-based repression has been introduced.
Here, we discuss how this new class of models differs dramatically from those
based on Hill-type repression in several fundamental aspects: conditions for
rhythm generation, robust network designs and the periods of coupled
oscillators. Consistently, these fundamental properties of circadian clocks
also differ among Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals depending on their key
transcriptional repression mechanisms (Hill-type repression or protein
sequestration). Based on both theoretical and experimental studies, this review
highlights the importance of careful modeling of transcriptional repression
mechanisms in molecular circadian clocks.

A large proportion of individuals in the present study were men who have had a few episodes of intermittent fasting for the first few weeks of life. One of the main differences during this time period during our study was that circadian clocks were not synchronized in this cohort.

Uniform Shock Waves in Disordered Granular Matter,"  The confining pressure $P$ is perhaps the most important parameter
controlling the properties of granular matter. Strongly compressed granular
media are, in many respects, simple solids in which elastic perturbations
travel as ordinary phonons. However, the speed of sound in granular aggregates
continuously decreases as the confining pressure decreases, completely
vanishing at the jamming-unjamming transition. This anomalous behavior suggests
that the transport of energy at low pressures should not be dominated by
phonons. In this work we use simulations and theory to show how the response of
granular systems becomes increasingly nonlinear as pressure decreases. In the
low pressure regime the elastic energy is found to be mainly transported
through nonlinear waves and shocks. We numerically characterize the propagation
speed, shape, and stability of these shocks, and model the dependence of the
shock speed on pressure and impact intensity by a simple analytical approach.

"Fundamental properties of solar-like oscillating stars from frequencies
  of minimum $\Delta \nu$ : II. Model computations for different chemical
  compositions and mass","  The large separations between the oscillation frequencies of solar-like stars
are measures of stellar mean density. The separations have been thought to be
mostly constant in the observed range of frequencies. However, detailed
investigation shows that they are not constant, and their variations are not
random but have very strong diagnostic potential for our understanding of
stellar structure and evolution. In this regard, frequencies of the minimum
large separation are very useful tools. From these frequencies, in addition to
the large separation and frequency of maximum amplitude, Y\i ld\i z et al.
recently have developed new methods to find almost all the fundamental stellar
properties. In the present study, we aim to find metallicity and helium
abundances from the frequencies, and generalize the relations given by Y\i ld\i
z et al. for a wider stellar mass range and arbitrary metallicity ($Z$) and
helium abundance ($Y$). We show that the effect of metallicity is {
significant} for most of the fundamental parameters. For stellar mass, for
example, the expression must be multiplied by $(Z/Z_{\sun})^{0.12}$. For
arbitrary helium abundance, $ M \propto (Y/Y_{\sun})^{0.25} $. Methods for
determination of $Z$ and $Y$ from pure asteroseismic quantities are based on
amplitudes (differences between maximum and minimum values of \Dnu) in the
oscillatory component in the spacing of oscillation frequencies. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the difference between the first maximum and the second
minimum is very sensitive to $Z$. It also depends on $\nu_{\rm min1}/\nu_{\rm
max}$ and small separation between the frequencies. Such a dependence leads us
to develop a method to find $Z$ (and $Y$) from oscillation frequencies. The
maximum difference between the estimated and model $Z$ values is about 14 per
cent. It is 10 per cent for $Y$.

"Kinematics of Simulated Galaxies I: Connecting Dynamical and
  Morphological Properties of Early-Type Galaxies at Different Redshifts","  State-of-the-art integral field surveys like $\mathrm{ATLAS^{3D}}$, SLUGGS,
CALIFA, SAMI, and MaNGA provide large data sets of kinematical observations of
early-type galaxies (ETGs), yielding constraints on the formation of ETGs.
Using the cosmological hydrodynamical \textit{Magneticum Pathfinder}
simulations, we investigate the paradigm of fast and slow rotating ETGs in a
fully cosmological context. We show that the ETGs within the
\textit{Magneticum} simulation are in remarkable agreement with the
observations, revealing fast and slow rotators quantified by the angular
momentum proxy $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the flattening $\epsilon$ with the
observed prevalence. Taking full advantage of the three-dimensional data, we
demonstrate that the dichotomy between fast and slow rotating galaxies gets
enhanced, showing an upper and lower population separated by an underpopulated
region in the edge-on $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane. Following the
evolution of the $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane through cosmic time,
we find that, while the upper population is already in place at $z=2$, the
lower population gets statistically significant below $z=1$ with a gradual
increase. At least $50\%$ of the galaxies transition from fast to slow rotators
on a short timescale, in most cases associated to a significant merger event.
Furthermore, we connect the $M_{*}$-$j_{*}$ plane, quantified by the $b$-value,
with the $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane, revealing a strong
correlation between the position of a galaxy in the
$\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane and the $b$-value. Going one step
further, we classify our sample based on features in their velocity map,
finding all five common kinematic groups, also including the recently observed
group of prolate rotators, populating distinct regions in the
$\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$b$ plane.

"System size dependence of nuclear modification and azimuthal anisotropy
  of jet quenching","  We investigate the system size dependence of jet-quenching by analyzing
transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ =200 GeV for different centralities. The fast partons
are assumed to lose energy by radiating gluons as they traverse the plasma and
undergo multiple collisions. The energy loss per collision, $\epsilon$, is
taken as proportional to $E$(where $E$ is the energy of the parton),
proportional to $\sqrt{E}$, or a constant depending on whether the formation
time of the gluon is less than the mean path, greater than the mean free path
but less than the path length, or greater than the path length of the partons,
respectively. NLO pQCD is used to evaluate pion production by modifying the
fragmentation function to account for the energy loss. We reproduce the nuclear
modification factor $R_\textrm{AA}$ by treating $\epsilon$ as the only free
parameter, depending on the centrality and the mechanism of energy loss. These
values are seen to explain the nuclear modification of prompt photons, caused
by the energy lost by final state quarks before they fragment into photons.
These also reproduce the azimuthal asymmetry of transverse momentum
distribution for pions within a factor of two and for prompt photons in a fair
agreement with experimental data.

"Lefschetz-thimble approach to the Silver Blaze problem of one-site
  fermion model","  The sign problem of finite-density QCD at the zero temperature becomes very
severe if the quark chemical potential exceeds half of the pion mass. In order
to understand its property, we consider the sign problem of the one-site
fermion model appearing in its path-integral expression by using the
Lefschetz-thimble method. We show that the original integration cycle becomes
decomposed into multiple Lefschetz thimbles at a certain value of the fermion
chemical potential, which would correspond to half of the pion mass of
finite-density QCD. This triggers a fictitious phase transition on each
Lefschetz thimble, and the interference of complex phases among them plays an
important role for the correct description of the system. We also show that the
complex Langevin method does not work in this situation.

Theory of Interacting Cavity Rydberg Polaritons,"  Photonic materials are an emerging platform to explore quantum matter and
quantum dynamics. The development of Rydberg electromagnetically induced
transparency provided a clear route to strong interactions between individual
optical photons. In conjunction with carefully designed optical resonators, it
is now possible to achieve extraordinary control of the properties of
individual photons, introducing tunable gauge fields whilst imbuing the photons
with mass and embedding them on curved spatial manifolds. Building on work
formalizing Rydberg-mediated interactions between propagating photons, we
develop a theory of interacting Rydberg polaritons in multimode optical
resonators, where the strong interactions are married with tunable
single-particle properties to build and probe exotic matter. In the presence of
strong coupling between the resonator field and a Rydberg-dressed atomic
ensemble, a quasiparticle called the ""cavity Rydberg polariton"" emerges. We
investigate its properties, finding that it inherits both the fast dynamics of
its photonic constituents and the strong interactions of its atomic
constituents. We develop tools to properly renormalize the interactions when
polaritons approach each other, and investigate the impact of atomic motion on
the coherence of multi-mode polaritons, showing that most channels for
atom-polariton cross-thermalization are strongly suppressed. Finally, we
propose to harness the repeated diffraction and refocusing of the optical
resonator to realize interactions which are local in momentum space. This work
points the way to efficient modeling of polaritonic quantum materials in
properly renormalized strongly interacting effective theories, thereby enabling
experimental studies of photonic fractional quantum Hall fluids and crystals,
plus photonic quantum information processors and repeaters.

Interacting cavities are located near the center of the sea ice zone and are typically much more complicated and have even greater influence on the behavior of polar birds and mammals. This article focuses on three common and frequent interactions within the cavity of sea urchins that we can measure in the Antarctic and Greenland, and on other species of marine animals.

"Bayesian Variable Selection for Ultrahigh-dimensional Sparse Linear
  Models","  We propose a Bayesian variable selection procedure for ultrahigh-dimensional
linear regression models. The number of regressors involved in regression,
$p_n$, is allowed to grow exponentially with $n$. Assuming the true model to be
sparse, in the sense that only a small number of regressors contribute to this
model, we propose a set of priors suitable for this regime. The model selection
procedure based on the proposed set of priors is shown to be variable selection
consistent when all the $2^{p_n}$ models are considered. In the
ultrahigh-dimensional setting, selection of the true model among all the
$2^{p_n}$ possible ones involves prohibitive computation. To cope with this, we
present a two-step model selection algorithm based on screening and Gibbs
sampling. The first step of screening discards a large set of unimportant
covariates, and retains a smaller set containing all the active covariates with
probability tending to one. In the next step, we search for the best model
among the covariates obtained in the screening step. This procedure is
computationally quite fast, simple and intuitive. We demonstrate competitive
performance of the proposed algorithm for a variety of simulated and real data
sets when compared with several frequentist, as well as Bayesian methods.

Converting a real quantum bath to an effective classical noise,"  We present a cluster expansion method for approximating quantum spin-bath
dynamics in terms of a classical Gaussian stochastic process. The cluster
expansion produces the two-point correlation function of the approximate
classical bath, permitting rapid evaluation of noise-mitigating quantum control
strategies without resorting to computationally intensive dynamical decoupling
models. Our approximation is valid for the wide class of models possessing
negligible back-action and nearly-Gaussian noise. We study several instances of
the central spin decoherence problem in which the central spin and
randomly-located bath spins are alike and dipolarly coupled. For various pulse
sequences, we compare the coherence echo decay computed explicitly quantum
mechanically versus those computed using our approximate classical model, and
obtain agreement in most, but not all, cases. We demonstrate the utility of
these classical noise models by efficiently searching for the 4-pulse sequences
that maximally mitigate decoherence in each of these cases, a computationally
expensive task in the explicit quantum model.

"The fragmenting past of the disk at the Galactic Center : The culprit
  for the missing red giants","  Since 1996 we have known that the Galactic Center (GC) displays a core-like
distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars starting at ~ 10"", which poses a
theoretical problem, because the GC should have formed a segregated cusp of old
stars. This issue has been addressed invoking stellar collisions, massive black
hole binaries, and infalling star clusters, which can explain it to some
extent. Another observational fact, key to the work presented here, is the
presence of a stellar disk at the GC. We postulate that the reason for the
missing stars in the RGB is closely intertwined with the disk formation, which
initially was gaseous and went through a fragmentation phase to form the stars.
Using simple analytical estimates, we prove that during fragmentation the disk
developed regions with densities much higher than a homogeneous gaseous disk,
i.e. ""clumps"", which were optically thick, and hence contracted slowly. Stars
in the GC interacted with them and in the case of RGB stars, the clumps were
dense enough to totally remove their outer envelopes after a relatively low
number of impacts. Giant stars in the horizontal branch (HB), however, have
much denser envelopes. Hence, the fragmentation phase of the disk must have had
a lower impact in their distribution, because it was more difficult to remove
their envelopes. We predict that future deeper observations of the GC should
reveal less depletion of HB stars and that the released dense cores of RGB
stars will still be populating the GC.
","The fragmenting past of the disk at the Galactic Center : The culprit
  for the missing red giants is a new finding from ESA. The galaxy Enceladus is about three billion light years from the Sun, and orbits a Sun-like gas giant known as the gas giants Bering and Uranus. In the past, these gas-giants were known to have broken apart, but their disappearance has raised questions about whether the ejected gas is really a giant. On July 24 th 2016, while still orbiting at around 700 AU, the giant Eris is finally spotted by the Large Magellanic Cloud, an infrared telescope and a team of astronomers with the Southern Ocean Observatory. Eos is so fast that the first galaxies to be detected there have nearly doubled their size already, in line with a previous trend. From this, new observations of Eros are expected to tell new insights into the mechanism that has led to their existence.

The formation of stars from a single mass of gas around the stars was a major event on the galactic scale. These events are known locally as ""satellite explosions"" and are the primary mechanisms of dark side formation, because these tiny particles interact quickly in the dark atmosphere where they are likely",0.27791446826880883,0.18243242744361773,0.19038980964067317

"GTC/CanariCam mid-IR imaging of the fullerene-rich Planetary Nebula IC
  418: searching for the spatial distribution of fullerene-like molecules","  We present seeing-limited narrow-band mid-IR GTC/CanariCam images of the
spatially extended fullerene-containing planetary nebula (PN) IC 418. The
narrow-band images cover the C60 fullerene band at 17.4 {\mu}m, the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon like (PAH-like) feature at 11.3 {\mu}m, the broad 9-13
{\mu}m feature, and their adjacent continua at 9.8 and 20.5 {\mu}m. We study
the relative spatial distribution of these complex species, all detected in the
Spitzer and Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) spectra of IC 418, with the aim of
getting observational constraints to the formation process of fullerenes in
H-rich circumstellar environments. A similar ring-like extended structure is
seen in all narrow-band filters, except in the dust continuum emission at 9.8
{\mu}m, which peaks closer to the central star. The continuum-subtracted images
display a clear ring-like extended structure for the carrier of the broad 9-13
{\mu}m emission, while the spatial distribution of the (PAH-like) 11.3 {\mu}m
emission is not so well defined. Interestingly, a residual C60 17.4 {\mu}m
emission (at about 4-{\sigma} from the sky background) is seen when subtracting
the dust continuum emission at 20.5 {\mu}m. This residual C60 emission, if
real, might have several interpretations; the most exciting being perhaps that
other fullerene-based species like hydrogenated fullerenes with very low
H-content may contribute to the observed 17.4 {\mu}m emission. We conclude that
higher sensitivity mid-IR images and spatially resolved spectroscopic
observations (especially in the Q-band) are necessary to get some clues about
fullerene formation in PNe.

Explosive spreading on complex networks: the role of synergy,"  In spite of the vast literature on spreading dynamics on complex networks,
the role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined
produce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been
studied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. Reversible spreading
dynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.
To fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local
synergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,
in which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an
infected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a
number of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the
synergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical
results. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the
strength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the
steady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate
exhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In
fact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the
invasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical
understanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated
hysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.

We discuss the implications of the coupling of various microorganisms in a single system and how to develop the single bacterial ecosystem along its many parts along with a discussion about co-immunity amongst the different bacterial groups and their relation to each other. On being connected to a distributed microorganism it is easy to make some assumptions concerning the mechanisms of action, as is indicated by the fact that the interactions among bacteria are closely linked throughout the system.

Technological imperfections of QKD systems have been previously explored, but

show the first full-field implementation of a complete attack on a running QKD

"Charge Imbalance in a Layered Structure of High Temperature
  Superconductors","  Quasiparticle injection devices are considered as one of the candidates for
the high temperature superconductor transistors, which can operate at liquid
nitrogen temperatures. In these devices the nonequilibrium effects are created
by injecting quasiparticle current into a stack of intrinsic Josephson
junctions (IJJs). These effects lead to an occurrence of a shift of the
condensate chemical potential and a difference in the distribution between the
electron-like and the hole-like quasiparticles that causes a charge imbalance.
Such effects are observed in many experiments for both bulk and layered
superconductors. In this paper, we study non-stationary nonequilibrium charge
imbalance effect due to current injection in a stack of IJJs. We investigate
the effect of the charge imbalance on the current-voltage characteristic (IVC)
and the time dependence of the voltage and the quasiparticle potential in a
stack of five IJJs.

  Impact","  Online social networks are known to be demographically biased. Currently
there are questions about what degree of representativity of the physical
population they have, and how population biases impact user-generated content.
In this paper we focus on centralism, a problem affecting Chile. Assuming that
local differences exist in a country, in terms of vocabulary, we built a
methodology based on the vector space model to find distinctive content from
different locations, and use it to create classifiers to predict whether the
content of a micro-post is related to a particular location, having in mind a
geographically diverse selection of micro-posts. We evaluate them in a case
study where we analyze the virtual population of Chile that participated in the
Twitter social network during an event of national relevance: the municipal
(local governments) elections held in 2012. We observe that the participating
virtual population is spatially representative of the physical population,
implying that there is centralism in Twitter. Our classifiers out-perform a non
geographically-diverse baseline at the regional level, and have the same
accuracy at a provincial level. However, our approach makes assumptions that
need to be tested in multi-thematic and more general datasets. We leave this
for future work.

Partisan Sharing: Facebook Evidence and Societal Consequences,"  The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people seek out information
that supports their views and eschew information that conflicts with their
beliefs, and that has negative consequences on our society. Few researchers
have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media:
users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what
happens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure,
though. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the
partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the
tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid
conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan
sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on
their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and
4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong
evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the
real world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political
program, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70
individuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan
sharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality. However, we
do also find positive aspects of partisan sharing: it is associated with people
who are more knowledgeable about politics and engage more with it as they are
more likely to vote in the general elections.

The problem consists, then, of developing a theory of an item, the relation between it and the problems on which it depends. According to this doctrine, theories and theories of a given substance should be found by showing how the substances interact with one another and how they change over time and with changing seasons. In the cases of certain substances, their properties may be the same in response to changing conditions as their constituents and in some cases, in general. But how can one explain the interactions of new substances in order to develop a new theory about them?

objective functions that arise frequently in statistics. We refer to this
connection using the term ""hierarchical duality."" Our results suggest an
interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between marginalization
and profiling, or equivalently between the Fenchel--Moreau theorem for convex
functions and the Bernstein--Widder theorem for Laplace transforms. We give
several different sets of conditions under which such a duality result obtains.
We then extend existing work on envelope representations in several ways,
including novel generalizations to variance-mean models and to multivariate
Gaussian location models. This turns out to provide an elegant missing-data
interpretation of the proximal gradient method, a widely used algorithm in
machine learning. We show several statistical applications in which the
proposed framework leads to easily implemented algorithms, including a robust
version of the fused lasso, nonlinear quantile regression via trend filtering,
and the binomial fused double Pareto model. Code for the examples is available
on GitHub at https://github.com/jgscott/hierduals.

"Proof of a modular relation between 1-, 2- and 3-loop Feynman diagrams
  on a torus","  The coefficients of the higher-derivative terms in the low energy expansion
of genus-one graviton Type II superstring scattering amplitudes are determined
by integrating sums of non-holomorphic modular functions over the complex
structure modulus of a torus. In the case of the four-graviton amplitude, each
of these modular functions is a multiple sum associated with a Feynman diagram
for a free massless scalar field on the torus. The lines in each diagram join
pairs of vertex insertion points and the number of lines defines its weight
$w$, which corresponds to its order in the low energy expansion. Previous
results concerning the low energy expansion of the genus-one four-graviton
amplitude led to a number of conjectured relations between modular functions of
a given $w$, but different numbers of loops $\le w-1$. In this paper we shall
prove the simplest of these conjectured relations, namely the one that arises
at weight $w=4$ and expresses the three-loop modular function $D_4$ in terms of
modular functions with one and two loops. As a byproduct, we prove three
intriguing new holomorphic modular identities.
","Proof of a modular relation between 1-, 2- and 3-loop Feynman diagrams
  on a torus is a very simple relation that gives a general value like 0<0 but I do not think it will take so much long an implementation to have a real use case. Furthermore, there are no obvious use cases, so it is not possible to make anything that takes up 0-2 loops (no obvious or complex example). In short, if you want to build one of these we need to use a lot of work and have to get some proofs of it. For obvious reasons, we recommend that you spend lots of time looking into it a few times. When we are not already on the subject we could perhaps expand on them in the following way: we should only show them when the function has a valid and consistent meaning.

Satisfying the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with massive particles,"  In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) questioned the completeness of
quantum mechanics by devising a quantum state of two massive particles with
maximally correlated space and momentum coordinates. The EPR criterion
qualifies such continuous-variable entangled states, where a measurement of one
subsystem seemingly allows for a prediction of the second subsystem beyond the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Up to now, continuous-variable EPR
correlations have only been created with photons, while the demonstration of
such strongly correlated states with massive particles is still outstanding.
Here, we report on the creation of an EPR-correlated two-mode squeezed state in
an ultracold atomic ensemble. The state shows an EPR entanglement parameter of
0.18(3), which is 2.4 standard deviations below the threshold 1/4 of the EPR
criterion. We also present a full tomographic reconstruction of the underlying
many-particle quantum state. The state presents a resource for tests of quantum
nonlocality and a wide variety of applications in the field of
continuous-variable quantum information and metrology.
","Satisfying the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with massive particles is clearly a better way for the experiment to be used.

I think it's also worth mentioning what this whole experiment means to us. We tend to expect that the same kind of effects we might get from one particle will be due to other particles in the whole group, because they are all the particles that have the best chance of being the source of a particular influence; but the probability that we get effects from more than one group can be greatly reduced. The results this experiment will reveal can't be explained by an experiment that's been running for months, as in this case it will show the inverse of the expected distribution of energy at the start of each experiment, which is to say that there must be no",0.24123314085007003,0.17821781680619558,0.17184873419849384
"Constraints on the Early Terrestrial Surface UV Environment Relevant to
  Prebiotic Chemistry","  The UV environment is a key boundary condition for the origin of life.
However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence
surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multi-layer clear-sky
calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV
surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and
atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can
affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of >10.4; for the same
atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the
equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Surface
conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences.
For climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189 nm is
screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from
variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding
from CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible
levels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off
comparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can
build up to the 1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can
dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H2O
is a robust UV shield for <198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of
other atmospheric gases, fluence <198 nm is only available for cold, dry
atmospheres, meaning sources with emission <198 nm (e.g. ArF eximer lasers) can
only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of
volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H2O
and is available across a broad range of CO2 columns, meaning that mercury
lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in
primordial H2O and CO2 levels.

"Crystal fields, disorder, and antiferromagnetic short-range order in
  Yb0.24Sn0.76Ru","  We report extensive measurements on a new compound (Yb0.24Sn0.76)Ru that
crystallizes in the cubic CsCl structure. Valence band photoemission and L3
x-ray absorption show no divalent component in the 4f configuration of Yb.
Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) indicates that the eight-fold degenerate
J-multiplet of Yb3+ is split by the crystalline electric field (CEF) into a
{\Gamma}7 doublet ground state and a {\Gamma}8 quartet at an excitation energy
20 meV. The magnetic susceptibility can be fit very well by this CEF scheme
under the assumption that a {\Gamma}6 excited state resides at 32 meV; however,
the {\Gamma}8/{\Gamma}6 transition expected at 12 meV was not observed in the
INS. The resistivity follows a Bloch- Gr\""uneisen law shunted by a parallel
resistor, as is typical of systems subject to phonon scattering with no
apparent magnetic scattering. All of these properties can be understood as
representing simple local moment behavior of the trivalent Yb ion. At 1 K,
there is a peak in specific heat that is too broad to represent a magnetic
phase transition, consistent with absence of magnetic reflections in neutron
diffraction. On the other hand, this peak also is too narrow to represent the
Kondo effect in the {\Gamma}7 ground state doublet. On the basis of the
field-dependence of the specific heat, we argue that antiferromagnetic
shortrange order (possibly co-existing with Kondo physics) occurs at low
temperatures. The long-range magnetic order is suppressed because the Yb site
occupancy is below the percolation threshold for this disordered compound.

Death by Dynamics: Planetoid-Induced Explosions on White Dwarfs,"  At intervals as short as ten thousand years, each white dwarf (WD) passes
within a solar radius of a planetoid, i.e., a comet, asteroid, or planet.
Gravitational tidal forces tear the planetoid apart; its metal-rich debris
falls onto the WD, enriching the atmosphere. A third of WDs exhibit atmospheric
""pollution"". For roughly every hundred planetoid disruptions, a planetoid
collides with a WD. We simulate a small number of collisions, in which
""death-by-dynamics"" refers to the fate of the planetoid. We also compute the
energies and likely durations of a broad sample of collision events, and
identify detection strategies at optical and X-ray wavelengths. Collisions with
the most massive planetoids can be detected in external galaxies. Some may
trigger nuclear burning. If one in $\sim 10^7-10^8$ of WD-planetoid collisions
creates the conditions needed for a Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia),
""death-by-dynamics"" would also refer to the fate of the WD, and could provide a
novel channel for the production of SN~Ia. We consider the circumstances under
which the rate of SNe~Ia can be increased by interactions with planetoids.

Thin n-in-p planar pixel modules for the ATLAS upgrade at HL-LHC,"  The ATLAS experiment will undergo a major upgrade of the tracker system in
view of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) foreseen to start around
2025. Thin planar pixel modules are promising candidates to instrument the new
pixel system, thanks to the reduced contribution to the material budget and
their high charge collection efficiency after irradiation. New designs of the
pixel cells, with an optimized biasing structure, have been implemented in
n-in-p planar pixel productions with sensor thicknesses of 270 um. Using beam
tests, the gain in hit efficiency is investigated as a function of the received
irradiation fluence. The outlook for future thin planar pixel sensor
productions will be discussed, with a focus on thin sensors with a thickness of
100 and 150 um and a novel design with the optimized biasing structure and
small pixel cells (50 um x 50 um and 25 um x 100 um). These dimensions are
foreseen for the new ATLAS read-out chip in 65 nm CMOS technology and the fine
segmentation will represent a challenge for the tracking in the forward region
of the pixel system at HL-LHC. To predict the performance of 50 um x 50 um

On the renormalization of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term,"  The bulk (Einstein-Hilbert) and boundary (Gibbons-Hawking) terms in the
gravitational action are generally renormalized differently when integrating
out quantum fluctuations. The former is affected by nonminimal couplings, while
the latter is affected by boundary conditions. We use the heat kernel method to
analyze this behavior for a nonminimally coupled scalar field, the Maxwell
field, and the graviton field. Allowing for Robin boundary conditions, we
examine in which cases the renormalization preserves the ratio of boundary and
bulk terms required for the effective action to possess a stationary point. The
implications for field theory and black hole entropy computations are
discussed.

"A Topological Investigation of Phase Transitions of Cascading Failures

power transmission grids. The economic cost of such failures is in the order of
tens of billion dollars annually. The loading level of power system is a key
aspect to determine the amount of the damage caused by cascading failures.
Existing studies show that the blackout size exhibits phase transitions as the
loading level increases. This paper investigates the impact of the topology of
a power grid on phase transitions in its robustness. Three spectral graph
metrics are considered: spectral radius, effective graph resistance and
algebraic connectivity. Experimental results from a model of cascading failures

On spacelike and timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$,"  We discuss timelike and spacelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$ using a

derived in a parallel treatment of both type of surfaces, with emphasis on
their characteristic differences. In the timelike case we find a formulation
corresponding to a complete gauge fixing of the torsion. In the spacelike case
we derive three sets of equations, related to different parameterizations
enforced by the Lorentzian signature of the metric in normal space. On the
basis of these equations, we prove that there are no flat spacelike minimal
surfaces in $AdS_n, n\geq 4$ beyond the four cusp surfaces used in the
Alday-Maldacena conjecture. Furthermore, we give a parameterization of flat
timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_5$ in terms of two chiral fields.

Birational modifications of surfaces via unprojections,"  We describe elementary transformations between minimal models of rational
surfaces in terms of unprojections. These do not fit into the framework of
Kustin-Miller unprojections as introduced by Papadakis and Reid, since we have
to leave the world of projectively Gorenstein varieties. Also, our
unprojections do not depend on the choice of the unprojection locus only, but
need extra data corresponding to the choice of a divisor on this unprojection
locus.
","Birational modifications of surfaces via unprojections using simple geometry can be applied to all layers of the image, allowing for increased performance when working with a larger number of layers. Because of its relatively simple nature this could potentially make it useful for applications on mobile and desktop environments.

"Analyzing Mobility-Traffic Correlations in Large WLAN Traces: Flutes vs.
  Cellos","  Two major factors affecting mobile network performance are mobility and
traffic patterns. Simulations and analytical-based performance evaluations rely
on models to approximate factors affecting the network. Hence, the
understanding of mobility and traffic is imperative to the effective evaluation
and efficient design of future mobile networks. Current models target either
mobility or traffic, but do not capture their interplay. Many trace-based
mobility models have largely used pre-smartphone datasets (e.g., AP-logs), or
much coarser granularity (e.g., cell-towers) traces. This raises questions
regarding the relevance of existing models, and motivates our study to revisit
this area. In this study, we conduct a multidimensional analysis, to
quantitatively characterize mobility and traffic spatio-temporal patterns, for
laptops and smartphones, leading to a detailed integrated mobility-traffic
analysis. Our study is data-driven, as we collect and mine capacious datasets
(with 30TB, 300k devices) that capture all of these dimensions. The
investigation is performed using our systematic (FLAMeS) framework. Overall,
dozens of mobility and traffic features have been analyzed. The insights and
lessons learnt serve as guidelines and a first step towards future integrated
mobility-traffic models. In addition, our work acts as a stepping-stone towards
a richer, more-realistic suite of mobile test scenarios and benchmarks.

Varieties of Mixing,"  We consider extensions of the notion of topological transitivity for a
dynamical system $(X,f)$. In addition to chain transitivity, we define strong
chain transitivity and vague transitivity. Associated with each there is a
notion of mixing, defined by transitivity of the product system $(X \times X, f
\times f)$. These extend the concept of weak mixing which is associated with
topological transitivity. Using the barrier functions of Fathi and Pageault, we
obtain for each of these extended notions a dichotomy result that a transitive
system of each type either satisfies the corresponding mixing condition or else
factors onto an appropriate type of equicontinuous minimal system. The
classical dichotomy result for minimal systems follows when it is shown that a
minimal system is weak mixing if and only if it is vague mixing.

Metastability limit for the nucleation of NaCl crystals in confinement,"  We study the spontaneous nucleation and growth of sodium chloride crystals
induced by controlled evaporation in confined geometries (microcapillaries)
spanning several orders of magnitude in volume. In all experiments, the
nucleation happens reproducibly at a very high supersaturation S~1.6 and is
independent of the size, shape and surface properties of the microcapillary. We
show from classical nucleation theory that this is expected: S~1.6 corresponds
to the point where nucleation first becomes observable on experimental time
scales. A consequence of the high supersaturations reached at the onset of
nucleation is the very rapid growth of a single skeletal (Hopper) crystal.
Experiments on porous media reveal also the formation of Hopper crystals in the
entrapped liquid pockets in the porous network and consequently underline the
fact that sodium chloride can easily reach high supersaturations, in spite of
what is commonly assumed for this salt.

Influence of Plasma Collective Effects on Cosmological Evolution,"  It is well-known that the universe was in a plasma state both before
decoupling and after reionization. However, the conventional wisdom has been
that the plasma effects are largely Debye-shielded and can thus be safely
ignored when considering large scale evolutions. Recently we showed that large
scale structure formation in the universe may actually be suppressed by the
plasma collective effect. Indeed, observational data indicate that the
conventional theoretical formula tends to overestimate the matter power
spectrum at scales $k>1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. In this paper, we further develop our
theory through a more thorough and general derivation of the
Maxwell-Einstein-Boltzmann equation. In addition to baryon density perturbation
post reionization, we apply this general formulation to investigate the
possible plasma effect on CMB anisotropy. As expected, while the plasma effect
does render an observable effect to the former, its impact on the latter is
totally negligible.

Although most models focus on the formation of the ""warp"" phase (Figure 6a), we argue that the actual phenomenon that produces these effects is much more complex. First, we note the interplay between the gravitational pull of a large body acting on an enormous component of matter and the effects on cosmic rays. Our study indicates that both physical and experimental evidence suggests that space-time conditions in space are important for explaining cosmic phenomena.

A test for cosmic distance duality,"  Testing the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) constitutes an important
task for cosmology and fundamental physics since any violation of it would be a
clear evidence of new physics. In this {\it Letter}, we propose a new test for
the CDDR using only measurements of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters
from Sunyaev-Zeldovich ($f_{SZE}$) and X-ray surface brightness ($f_{X-ray}$)
observations. We show that the relation between current $f_{X-ray}$ and
$f_{SZE}$ observations is given by $f_{SZE}=\eta f_{X-ray}$, where $\eta$
quantifies deviations from the CDDR. Since this latter expression is valid for
the same object in a given galaxy cluster sample, the method proposed removes
possible contaminations from different systematics error sources and redshift
differences involved in luminosity and angular diameter distance measurements.
We apply this cosmological model-independent methodology to the most recent
$f_{X-ray}$ and $f_{SZE}$ data and show that no significant violation of the
CDDR is found.

"Conductance Discontinuity on the Surface of a Topological Insulator with
  Magnetic Electrodes","  Asymmetric electrical conductance is theoretically demonstrated on the
surface of a topological insulator (TI) in the limit of infinitesimally small
forward and reverse biases between two spin selective electrodes. The
discontinuous behavior relies on the spin-momentum interlocked nature of TI
surface electrons together with the resulting imbalance in the coupling
coefficients between the electrodes and TI surface states. The analysis is
based on a transmission matrix model that, in combination with a
phenomenological treatment for the diffusive limit, accounts for both ballistic
and scattered paths simultaneously. With the estimated conductance asymmetry
over a factor of 10, implementation in the ratchet-like applications and
low-voltage rectification circuits appears practicable.

"Calibration of the Mixing-Length Theory for Convective White Dwarf
  Envelopes","  A calibration of the mixing-length parameter in the local mixing-length
theory (MLT) is presented for the lower part of the convection zone in
pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. The parameterization is performed from a
comparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying
mixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted
to the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations
suggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change
significantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately
below the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic
of the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The
calibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the
effective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity
range 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to
reproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of
the 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for
these quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and
envelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and
convective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the
white dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the
degenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are
insensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,
hence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.

Unlike continuous-time filters, the EKF-MCMC approach avoids numerical
integration, and so is more computational efficient, given the length of our

Results show, for example, that observational learning and add-on ratings
increase the demand for Firefox add-ons; add-ons can increase the market

platform success; and OSS platforms (i.e. Chrome and Firefox) compete rather

Assessment of Source Code Obfuscation Techniques,"  Obfuscation techniques are a general category of software protections widely
adopted to prevent malicious tampering of the code by making applications more
difficult to understand and thus harder to modify. Obfuscation techniques are
divided in code and data obfuscation, depending on the protected asset. While
preliminary empirical studies have been conducted to determine the impact of
code obfuscation, our work aims at assessing the effectiveness and efficiency
in preventing attacks of a specific data obfuscation technique - VarMerge. We
conducted an experiment with student participants performing two attack tasks
on clear and obfuscated versions of two applications written in C. The
experiment showed a significant effect of data obfuscation on both the time
required to complete and the successful attack efficiency. An application with
VarMerge reduces by six times the number of successful attacks per unit of
time. This outcome provides a practical clue that can be used when applying
software protections based on data obfuscation.

"From deep inelastic scattering to heavy-flavor semi-leptonic decays:
  Total rates into multi-hadron final states from lattice QCD","  We present a new technique for extracting decay and transition rates into
final states with any number of hadrons. The approach is only sensitive to
total rates, in which all out-states with a given set of QCD quantum numbers
are included. For processes involving photons or leptons, differential rates
with respect to the non-hadronic kinematics may also be extracted. Our method
involves constructing a finite-volume Euclidean four-point function, whose
corresponding spectral function measures the decay and transition rates in the
infinite-volume limit. This requires solving the inverse problem of extracting
the spectral function from the correlator and also necessitates a smoothing
procedure so that a well-defined infinite-volume limit exists. Both of these
steps are accomplished by the Backus-Gilbert method and, as we show with a
numerical example, reasonable precision can be expected in cases with multiple
open decay channels. Potential applications include nucleon structure functions

"Dynamical instabilities and quasi-normal modes, a spectral analysis with
  applications to black-hole physics","  Black hole dynamical instabilities have been mostly studied in specific
models. We here study the general properties of the complex-frequency modes
responsible for such instabilities, guided by the example of a charged scalar
field in an electrostatic potential. We show that these modes are square
integrable, have a vanishing conserved norm, and appear in mode doublets or
quartets. We also study how they appear in the spectrum and how their complex
frequencies subsequently evolve when varying some external parameter. When
working on an infinite domain, they appear from the reservoir of quasi-normal
modes obeying outgoing boundary conditions. This is illustrated by
generalizing, in a non-positive definite Krein space, a solvable model
(Friedrichs model) which originally describes the appearance of a resonance
when coupling an isolated system to a mode continuum. In a finite spatial
domain instead, they arise from the fusion of two real frequency modes with
opposite norms, through a process that closely resembles avoided crossing.

(GRBs) which show significant GeV emissions (GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB

consisting of a blackbody and a power-law to fit the spectra. We find that for
the latter model there are indications for an additional soft component in the
spectra. While previous studies have shown that such models are required for
GRB 090902B, here we find that a composite spectral model consisting of two
black bodies and a power law adequately fit the data of all the three bright
GRBs. We investigate the evolution of the spectral parameters and find several
generic interesting features for all three GRBs, like a) temperatures of the
black bodies are strongly correlated to each other, b) flux in the black body
components are strongly correlated to each other, c) the temperatures of the
black body trace the profile of the individual pulses of the GRBs, and d) the
characteristics of the power law component like the spectral index and the
delayed onset bear a close similarity to the emission characteristics in the
GeV regions. We discuss the implications of these results to the possibility of
identifying the radiation mechanisms during the prompt emission of GRBs.

  classification and genome-wide applications","  A cascading system of hierarchical, artificial neural networks (named
PRED-CLASS) is presented for the generalized classification of proteins into
four distinct classes-transmembrane, fibrous, globular, and mixed-from
information solely encoded in their amino acid sequences. The architecture of
the individual component networks is kept very simple, reducing the number of
free parameters (network synaptic weights) for faster training, improved
generalization, and the avoidance of data overfitting. Capturing information
from as few as 50 protein sequences spread among the four target classes (6
transmembrane, 10 fibrous, 13 globular, and 17 mixed), PRED-CLASS was able to
obtain 371 correct predictions out of a set of 387 proteins (success rate
approximately 96%) unambiguously assigned into one of the target classes. The
application of PRED-CLASS to several test sets and complete proteomes of
several organisms demonstrates that such a method could serve as a valuable
tool in the annotation of genomic open reading frames with no functional
assignment or as a preliminary step in fold recognition and ab initio structure
prediction methods. Detailed results obtained for various data sets and

"On the HI column density - radio source size anti-correlation in compact
  radio sources","  Existing studies of the atomic hydrogen gas content in distant galaxies,
through the absorption of the 21-cm line, often infer that the total column
density is anti-correlated with the linear extent of the background radio
source. We investigate this interpretation, by dissecting the various
parameters from which the column density is derived, and find that the
relationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth, which, for a
given absorber size, is anti-correlated with the linear size. Therefore, the
inferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry, in conjunction
with the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for each
member of the sample, an assumption for which there is scant observational
justification. While geometry can explain the observed correlation, many radio
sources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two
component emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber. From this, the observed
optical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models which
approximate either of the two Fanaroff & Riley classifications, although the
observed scatter in the sample cannot be duplicated using a single deprojected
radio source size. Furthermore, the trend is best reproduced using an absorber
of diameter ~100 - 1000 pc, which is also the range of values of linear sizes
at which the 21-cm detection rate peaks. This may indicate that this is the
characteristic linear size of the absorbing gas structure.

The Luminosity Functions and Timescales of MYSOs and Compact HII regions,"  We present a determination of the luminosity functions of massive young
stellar objects (MYSOs) and compact (C)HII regions within the Milky Way Galaxy
using the large, well-selected sample of these sources identified by the Red
MSX Source (RMS) survey. The MYSO luminosity function decreases monotonically
such that there are few with $L\gtrsim 10^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII regions are
detected up to ~10$^{6}Lsol. The lifetimes of these phases are also calculated
as a function of luminosity by comparison with the luminosity function for
local main-sequence OB stars. These indicate that the MYSO phase has a duration
ranging from 4x10$^{5}$ yrs for 10$^{4}$Lsol to ~7x10$^{4}$ yrs at
10$^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII region phase lasts of order 3x10$^{5}$ yrs or
~3-10% of the exciting star's main-sequence lifetime. MYSOs between 10$^{4}
Lsol and ~10$^{5}$ Lsol are massive but do not display the radio continuum or
near-IR \HI{} recombination line emission indicative of an HII region,
consistent with being swollen due to high ongoing or recent accretion rates.
Above ~10$^{5}$ Lsol the MYSO phase lifetime becomes comparable to the
main-sequence Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, at which point the central star can
rapidly contract onto the main-sequence even if still accreting, and ionise a
CHII region, thus explaining why few highly luminous MYSOs are observed.

Graphene-based tortional resonator from molecular dynamics simulation,"  Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study graphene-based
torsional mechanical resonators. The quality factor is calculated by
$Q_{F}=\omega\tau/2\pi$, where the frequency $\omega$ and life time $\tau$ are
obtained from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate. Our
simulations reveal the radius-dependence of the quality factor as
$Q_{F}=2628/(22R^{-1}+0.004R^{2})$, which yields a maximum value at some proper
radius $R$. This maximum point is due to the strong boundary effect in the
torsional resonator, as disclosed by the temperature distribution in the
resonator. Resulting from the same boundary effect, the quality factor shows a
power law temperature-dependence with power factors bellow 1.0. The theoretical

"Global disorder transition in the community structure of large-q Potts
  systems","  We examine a global disorder transition when identifying community structure
in an arbitrary complex network. Earlier, we illustrated [Phil. Mag. 92, 406
(2012)] that ""community detection"" (CD) generally exhibits disordered (or
unsolvable) and ordered (solvable) phases of both high and low computational
complexity along with corresponding transitions from regular to chaotic
dynamics in derived systems. Using an exact generalized dimensional reduction
inequality, multivariate Tutte polynomials, and other considerations, we
illustrate how increasing the number of communities q emulates increasing the
heat bath temperature T for a general weighted Potts model, leading to global
disorder in the community structure of arbitrary large graphs. Dimensional
reduction bounds lead to results similar to those suggested by mean-field type
approaches. Large systems tend toward global insolvability in the limit of
large q above a crossover temperature $T_\times\approx L|J_e|/[N\ln{} q]$ where
|J_e| is a typical interaction strength, L is the number of edges, and N is the
number of nodes. For practical system sizes, a solvable phase is generally
accessible at low T. The global nature of the disorder transition does not
preclude solutions by local CD algorithms (even those that employ global cost
function parameters) as long as community evaluations are locally determined.
","Global disorder transition in the community structure of large-q Potts
  systems (i.e., community networks consisting of a large area where each family has a distinct, individual structure and in which there is an extensive social structure). We find that the distribution of these large family structures is very positive in those who are in large families, which is clearly the case in a small, small-sibling case. In general, large brotherhood is more common, because the family structure is strong and is stable throughout the formation of the families. Within this small family, many of our hypotheses extend beyond small siblings. For example, in people with family disorders, a common family name is associated with a higher likelihood of having certain behaviors, including aggression or other mental disorder, such as child abuse, aggression to the head, and so forth. The name of this family is also related in some ways to social patterns, to other social networks, or to personality.

Can dynamical synapses produce true self-organized criticality?,"  Neuronal networks can present activity described by power-law distributed
avalanches presumed to be a signature of a critical state. Here we study a
random-neighbor network of excitable cellular automata coupled by dynamical
synapses. The model exhibits a very similar to conservative self-organized
criticality (SOC) models behavior even with dissipative bulk dynamics. This
occurs because in the stationary regime the model is conservative on average,
and, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability distribution for the global
branching ratio converges to a delta-function centered at its critical value.
So, this non-conservative model pertain to the same universality class of
conservative SOC models and contrasts with other dynamical synapses models that
present only self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Analytical results show
very good agreement with simulations of the model and enable us to study the
emergence of SOC as a function of the parametric derivatives of the stationary
branching ratio.
","Can dynamical synapses produce true self-organized criticality?

By using the same magnetic field, a dynamically stimulated synapse can create critical power. This potential energy is released from the magnetism of surrounding magnetites, and the resulting magnetite becomes part of a magnetic pole. The pole can then be manipulated to generate a potential electron, which can be transformed into an ion. To do so, we attach a thin wire to one of the electron's charged centers and control that charge. Once that happens, this signal is emitted (itself converted) to a superposition of energy, creating a total magnetic force to carry out the basic step.

The solar system in general is in a very good state, but with an unusually large amount of activity. With the first mass impact from an Earth-sized planet on September 9, 2013, it should be able to return to its original position as a planet, and the subsequent large-scale solar event should cause the entire solar cycle to begin before the end of 2014. It will therefore take around three decades to complete the work of returning to a complete solar eclipse.

The eclipse's timing is not guaranteed, so expect several hours of sky to be cloudy by the night of 20th-21st the day before (and after) the eclipse to bring total solar activity to peak. This will then bring the total Sun's total mass to 1.13 Earths at the peak of its massive cycle—the most distant eclipsor ever encountered.

from an ensemble of quantum-dot-like nanostructures with a very large in-plane
shape anisotropy (quantum dashes). We show that the measured degree of linear
polarization of the emitted light increases with the excitation power and
changes with temperature in a non-trivial way, depending on the excitation
conditions. Using an approximate model based on the k.p theory, we are able to
relate this degree of polarization to the amount of light hole admixture in the
exciton states which, in turn, depends on the symmetry of the envelope wave
function. Agreement between the measured properties and theory is reached under
assumption that the ground exciton state in a quantum dash is trapped in a
confinement fluctuation within the structure and thus localized in a much
smaller volume of much lower asymmetry than the entire nanostructure.
","Carrier trapping and luminescence polarization in quantum dashes of light were examined, where the electron beam polarized light between the two photons, a characteristic behavior of quantum dots in the classical sense. The light from the second photon polarized with the photon from an atom of the double D atom was captured by a super-position of high-polarity photons and electron beams, each of which can be quantized by using a single probe beam of polarization. As shown in Fig., with individual probe beams of different durations the quantum dot of electron output in single electron probe would remain the same from day to day.

Possible explanations for fine-tuning of the universe,"  The Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and the multi-local field theory are
interesting and promising candidates for solving the naturalness problem in the
universe. These theories are based on the different physical principles: The
former assumes the micro-canonical partition function $\int {\cal{D}}\phi\
\prod_i \delta (S_i^{}-I_i^{})$, and the latter assumes the partition function
$\int {\cal{D}}\phi\ \exp\left(iS_M^{}\right)$ where $S_M^{}$ is the
multi-local action $\sum_i c_i^{}S_i^{}+\sum_{i,j}c_{i,j}^{}S_i^{}S_j^{}+\cdots
$. Our main purpose is to show that they are equivalent in the sense that they
predict the same fine-tuning mechanism. In order to clarify our argument, we
first study (review) the similarity between the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and
statistical mechanics in detail, and show that the dynamical fine-tuning in the
former picture can be understood completely in the same way as the
determination of the temperature in the latter picture. Afterward, we discuss
the multi-local theory and the equivalence between it and the the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Because the multi-local field theory can be
obtained from physics at the Planck/String scale, this equivalence indicates
that the micro-canonical picture can also originate in such physics. As a
concrete example, we also review the IIB matrix model as an origin of the
multi-local theory.
","Possible explanations for fine-tuning of the universe:

A general, but different, problem is that the Universe might get slightly smaller from time to time because there might be more energy left after a certain amount of time (such as billions of years from now). We have known that we can get this by changing some kind of special relativity that happens during very long lengths of astronomical time – e.g., the long intervals of a star's rotation. And the new theory is based on the fact that there has been a change in the physical laws (the laws of evolution) when we saw a very low amount (1.3 billion years or so). In other words, it might give us an indication of future conditions such as the collapse of star-forming objects or the merger of galaxies, like a massive black hole.

"Non-equilibrium of Ionization and the Detection of Hot Plasma in
  Nanoflare-heated Coronal Loops","  Impulsive nanoflares are expected to transiently heat the plasma confined in
coronal loops to temperatures of the order of 10 MK. Such hot plasma is hardly
detected in quiet and active regions, outside flares. During rapid and short
heat pulses in rarified loops the plasma can be highly out of equilibrium of
ionization. Here we investigate the effects of the non-equilibrium of
ionization (NEI) on the detection of hot plasma in coronal loops.
Time-dependent loop hydrodynamic simulations are specifically devoted to this
task, including saturated thermal conduction, and coupled to the detailed
solution of the equations of ionization rate for several abundant elements. In
our simulations, initially cool and rarified magnetic flux tubes are heated to
10 MK by nanoflares deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop apex. We
test for different pulse durations, and find that, due to NEI effects, the loop
plasma may never be detected at temperatures above ~5 MK for heat pulses
shorter than about 1 min. We discuss some implications in the framework of
multi-stranded nanoflare-heated coronal loops.

A Radiative Transfer Framework for Spatially-Correlated Materials,"  We introduce a non-exponential radiative framework that takes into account
the local spatial correlation of scattering particles in a medium. Most
previous works in graphics have ignored this, assuming uncorrelated media with
a uniform, random local distribution of particles. However, positive and
negative correlation lead to slower- and faster-than-exponential attenuation
respectively, which cannot be predicted by the Beer-Lambert law. As our results
show, this has a major effect on extinction, and thus appearance. From recent
advances in neutron transport, we first introduce our Extended Generalized
Boltzmann Equation, and develop a general framework for light transport in
correlated media. We lift the limitations of the original formulation,
including an analysis of the boundary conditions, and present a model suitable
for computer graphics, based on optical properties of the media and statistical
distributions of scatterers. In addition, we present an analytic expression for
transmittance in the case of positive correlation, and show how to incorporate
it efficiently into a Monte Carlo renderer. We show results with a wide range
of both positive and negative correlation, and demonstrate the differences
compared to classic light transport.
","A Radiative Transfer Framework for Spatially-Correlated Materials (RTCM) - RTCMS was developed following the success of RCRA and was designed to assist in the investigation of transfer of material from a commercial supplier into materials that later from the supplier's work.

"Assessment of the GLLB-SC potential for solid-state properties and
  attempts for improvement","  Based on the work of Gritsenko et al. (GLLB) [Phys. Rev. A 51, 1944 (1995)],
the method of Kuisma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 82, 115106 (2010)] to calculate the
band gap in solids was shown to be much more accurate than the common local
density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The
main feature of the GLLB-SC potential (SC stands for solid and correlation) is
to lead to a nonzero derivative discontinuity that can be conveniently
calculated and then added to the Kohn-Sham band gap for a comparison with the
experimental band gap. In this work, a thorough comparison of GLLB-SC with
other methods, e.g., the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential [F. Tran and P.
Blaha, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 226401 (2009)], for electronic, magnetic, and
density-related properties is presented. It is shown that for the band gap,
GLLB-SC does not perform as well as mBJ for systems with a small band gap and
strongly correlated systems, but is on average of similar accuracy as hybrid
functionals. The results on itinerant metals indicate that GLLB-SC
overestimates significantly the magnetic moment (much more than mBJ does), but
leads to excellent results for the electric field gradient, for which mBJ is in
general not recommended. In the aim of improving the results, variants of the
GLLB-SC potential are also tested.

"Total variation approximation for quasi-equilibrium distributions, II","  Quasi-stationary distributions, as discussed by Darroch & Seneta (1965), have
been used in biology to describe the steady state behaviour of population
models which, while eventually certain to become extinct, nevertheless maintain
an apparent stochastic equilibrium for long periods. These distributions have
some drawbacks: they need not exist, nor be unique, and their calculation can
present problems. In an earlier paper, we gave biologically plausible
conditions under which the quasi-stationary distribution is unique, and can be
closely approximated by distributions that are simple to compute. In this
paper, we consider conditions under which the quasi-stationary distribution, if
it exists, need not be unique, but an apparent stochastic equilibrium can
nonetheless be identified and computed; we call such a distribution a
quasi-equilibrium distribution.

"Crash: A Block-Adaptive-Mesh Code for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics -
  Implementation and Verification","  We describe the CRASH (Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics) code, a
block adaptive mesh code for multi-material radiation hydrodynamics. The
implementation solves the radiation diffusion model with the gray or multigroup
method and uses a flux limited diffusion approximation to recover the
free-streaming limit. The electrons and ions are allowed to have different
temperatures and we include a flux limited electron heat conduction. The
radiation hydrodynamic equations are solved in the Eulerian frame by means of a
conservative finite volume discretization in either one, two, or
three-dimensional slab geometry or in two-dimensional cylindrical symmetry. An
operator split method is used to solve these equations in three substeps: (1)
solve the hydrodynamic equations with shock-capturing schemes, (2) a linear
advection of the radiation in frequency-logarithm space, and (3) an implicit
solve of the stiff radiation diffusion, heat conduction, and energy exchange.
We present a suite of verification test problems to demonstrate the accuracy
and performance of the algorithms. The CRASH code is an extension of the

"Compact radio sources and jet-driven AGN feedback in the early Universe:
  Constraints from integral-field spectroscopy","  To investigate the impact of radio jets during the formation epoch of their
massive host galaxies, we present an analysis of two massive, log(M_stel/
M_sun)~10.6 and 11.3, compact radio galaxies at z=3.5, TNJ0205+2242 and
TNJ0121+1320. Their small radio sizes (R<= 10 kpc) are most likely a sign of
youth. We compare their radio properties and gas dynamics with those in well
extended radio galaxies at high redshift, which show strong evidence for
powerful, jet-driven outflows of significant gas masses (M 10^9-10 M_sun). Our
analysis combines rest-frame optical integral-field spectroscopy with existing
radio imaging, CO emission line spectra, and rest-frame UV spectroscopy.
[OIII]5007 line emission is compact in both galaxies and lies within the region
defined by the radio lobes. For TNJ0205+2242, the Ly-alpha profile narrows
significantly outside the jet radius, indicating the presence of a quiescent
halo. TNJ0121+1320 has two components separated by ~10 kpc and a velocity
offset of ~300 km s^-1. If motions are gravitational, this implies a dynamical
mass of 2x10^11 M_sun for the more massive, radio-loud component. The dynamical
mass, molecular gas mass measured from the CO line emission, and radio
luminosity of these two compact radio galaxies imply that compact radio sources
may well develop large-scale, energetic outflows as observed in extended radio
galaxies, with the potential of removing significant fractions of the ISM from
the host galaxy. The absence of luminous emission line gas extending beyond the
radio emission in these sources agrees with the observed timescales and outflow
rates in extended radio galaxies, and adds further evidence that the energetic,
large-scale outflows observed in extended radio sources (Nesvadba et al. 2006)
are indeed the result of influence of the radio jet.

Inductive Logic Boosting,"  Recent years have seen a surge of interest in Probabilistic Logic Programming
(PLP) and Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with
probabilities. Structure learning of these systems is an intersection area of
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and statistical learning (SL). However, ILP
cannot deal with probabilities, SL cannot model relational hypothesis. The
biggest challenge of integrating these two machine learning frameworks is how
to estimate the probability of a logic clause only from the observation of
grounded logic atoms. Many current methods models a joint probability by
representing clause as graphical model and literals as vertices in it. This
model is still too complicate and only can be approximate by pseudo-likelihood.
We propose Inductive Logic Boosting framework to transform the relational
dataset into a feature-based dataset, induces logic rules by boosting Problog
Rule Trees and relaxes the independence constraint of pseudo-likelihood.
Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the AUC-PR and
AUC-ROC value of ILP learned rules are higher than current state-of-the-art SRL
methods.

Seasonality in Dynamic Stochastic Block Models,"  Sociotechnological and geospatial processes exhibit time varying structure
that make insight discovery challenging. This paper proposes a new statistical
model for such systems, modeled as dynamic networks, to address this challenge.
It assumes that vertices fall into one of k types and that the probability of
edge formation at a particular time depends on the types of the incident nodes
and the current time. The time dependencies are driven by unique seasonal
processes, which many systems exhibit (e.g., predictable spikes in geospatial
or web traffic each day). The paper defines the model as a generative process
and an inference procedure to recover the seasonal processes from data when
they are unknown. Evaluation with synthetic dynamic networks show the recovery
of the latent seasonal processes that drive its formation.

"Influence of a large-scale field on energy dissipation in
  magnetohydrodynamic turbulence","  In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the large-scale magnetic field sets
a preferred local direction for the small-scale dynamics, altering the
statistics of turbulence from the isotropic case. This happens even in the
absence of a total magnetic flux, since MHD turbulence forms randomly oriented
large-scale domains of strong magnetic field. It is therefore customary to
study small-scale magnetic plasma turbulence by assuming a strong background
magnetic field relative to the turbulent fluctuations. This is done, for
example, in reduced models of plasmas, such as reduced MHD, reduced-dimension
kinetic models, gyrokinetics, etc., which make theoretical calculations easier
and numerical computations cheaper. Recently, however, it has become clear that
the turbulent energy dissipation is concentrated in the regions of strong
magnetic field variations. A significant fraction of the energy dissipation may
be localized in very small volumes corresponding to the boundaries between
strongly magnetized domains. In these regions the reduced models are not
applicable. This has important implications for studies of particle heating and
acceleration in magnetic plasma turbulence. The goal of this work is to
systematically investigate the relationship between local magnetic field
variations and magnetic energy dissipation, and to understand its implications
for modeling energy dissipation in realistic turbulent plasmas.

the Sun by using a seismic-holography technique. As in previous works, the
method is based on the comparison of waves going in and out of a particular
point in the Sun but we have computed here the Green's functions from a
spherical polar expansion of the adiabatic wave equations in the Cowling
approximation instead of using the ray-path approximation previously used in
the far-side holography. A comparison between the results obtained using the
ray theory and the spherical polar expansion is shown. We use the
gravito-acoustic wave equation in the local plane-parallel limit in both cases
and for the latter we take the asymptotic approximation for the radial
dependencies of the Green's function. As a result, improved images of the
far-side can be obtained from the polar-expansion approximation, especially
when combining the Green's functions corresponding to two and three skips. We
also show that the phase corrections in the Green's functions due to the
incorrect modeling of the uppermost layers of the Sun can be estimated from the

Measurement-wise Occlusion in Multi-object Tracking,"  Handling object interaction is a fundamental challenge in practical
multi-object tracking, even for simple interactive effects such as one object
temporarily occluding another. We formalize the problem of occlusion in
tracking with two different abstractions. In object-wise occlusion, objects
that are occluded by other objects do not generate measurements. In
measurement-wise occlusion, a previously unstudied approach, all objects may
generate measurements but some measurements may be occluded by others. While
the relative validity of each abstraction depends on the situation and sensor,
measurement-wise occlusion fits into probabilistic multi-object tracking
algorithms with much looser assumptions on object interaction. Its value is
demonstrated by showing that it naturally derives a popular approximation for
lidar tracking, and by an example of visual tracking in image space.
","Measurement-wise Occlusion in Multi-object Tracking (MTP), a new classification tool for computer vision, has developed a classification method that improves the accuracy of multivariate classification. While MTP is the preferred classification criterion for visual inspection of images, it can sometimes be used to classify individual objects in a way that results in an accurate representation. The new method allows multinarray imaging to be performed using more than five billion subjects.

The new system also utilizes algorithms designed to detect when subjects, in the wrong category, tend to show signs of different behavioral or physiological states. For example:

"A Low-Delay Low-Complexity EKF Design for Joint Channel and CFO
  Estimation in Multi-User Cognitive Communications","  Parameter estimation in cognitive communications can be formulated as a
multi-user estimation problem, which is solvable under maximum likelihood
solution but involves high computational complexity. This paper presents a
time-sharing and interference mitigation based EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)
design for joint CFO (carrier frequency offset) and channel estimation at
multiple cognitive users. The key objective is to realize low implementation
complexity by decomposing highdimensional parameters into multiple separate
low-dimensional estimation problems, which can be solved in a time-shared
manner via pipelining operation. We first present a basic EKF design that
estimates the parameters from one TX user to one RX antenna. Then such basic
design is time-shared and reused to estimate parameters from multiple TX users
to multiple RX antennas. Meanwhile, we use interference mitigation module to
cancel the co-channel interference at each RX sample. In addition, we further
propose adaptive noise variance tracking module to improve the estimation
performance. The proposed design enjoys low delay and low buffer size (because
of its online real-time processing), as well as low implementation complexity
(because of time-sharing and pipeling design). Its estimation performance is
verified to be close to Cramer-Rao bound.

A Parametric Simplex Algorithm for Linear Vector Optimization Problems,"  In this paper, a parametric simplex algorithm for solving linear vector
optimization problems (LVOPs) is presented. This algorithm can be seen as a
variant of the multi-objective simplex (Evans-Steuer) algorithm [12]. Different
from it, the proposed algorithm works in the parameter space and does not aim
to find the set of all efficient solutions. Instead, it finds a solution in the
sense of Loehne [16], that is, it finds a subset of efficient solutions that
allows to generate the whole frontier. In that sense, it can also be seen as a
generalization of the parametric self-dual simplex algorithm, which originally
is designed for solving single objective linear optimization problems, and is
modified to solve two objective bounded LVOPs with the positive orthant as the
ordering cone in Ruszczynski and Vanderbei [21]. The algorithm proposed here
works for any dimension, any solid pointed polyhedral ordering cone C and for
bounded as well as unbounded problems. Numerical results are provided to
compare the proposed algorithm with an objective space based LVOP algorithm
(Benson algorithm in [13]), that also provides a solution in the sense of [16],
and with Evans-Steuer algorithm [12]. The results show that for non-degenerate
problems the proposed algorithm outperforms Benson algorithm and is on par with
Evan-Steuer algorithm. For highly degenerate problems Benson's algorithm [13]
excels the simplex-type algorithms; however, the parametric simplex algorithm
is for these problems computationally much more efficient than Evans-Steuer
algorithm.

Nonlinear Dynamics in a Magnetic Josephson Junction,"  We theoretically consider a Josephson junction formed by a ferromagnetic
spacer with a strong spin-orbit interaction or a magnetic spin valve, i.e., a
bilayer with one static and one free layer. Electron spin transport facilitates
a nonlinear dynamical coupling between the magnetic moment and charge current,
which consists of normal and superfluid components. By phenomenologically
adding reactive and dissipative interactions (guided by structural and Onsager
symmetries), we construct magnetic torques and charge pumping, whose
microscopic origins are also discussed. A stability analysis of our coupled
nonlinear systems generates a rich phase diagram with fixed points, limit
cycles, and quasiperiodic states. Our findings reduce to the known phase
diagrams for current-biased nonmagnetic Josephson junctions, on the one hand,
and spin-torque driven magnetic films, on the other, in the absence of coupling
between the magnetic and superconducting order parameters.

branch (AGB) star R~Doradus was taken with ALMA in cycle 2 at frequencies

Estimating the Prevalence of Deception in Online Review Communities,"  Consumers' purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated
online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential
for posting ""deceptive opinion spam"" -- fictitious reviews that have been
deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while this
practice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively
little is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online
review communities, and less still about the factors that influence it.
  We propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with a
deception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six
popular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline,
TripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of online
reviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminish
the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting
as a signal to a product's true, unknown quality. We find that deceptive
opinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth rates
across communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the different
signaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g.,
posting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,
filtering reviews written by first-time reviewers, deception prevalence is
effectively reduced.

corresponding examples in the divergence case are also discussed. One
implication of these examples is that the ranges of $p$ are sharp in the recent

On interrelations between divergence-free and Hamiltonian dynamics,"  A mathematically correct description is presented on the interrelations
between the dynamics of divergence free vector fields on an oriented
3-dimensional manifold $M$ and the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. It is shown
that for a given divergence free vector field $X$ with a global cross-section
there exist some 4-dimensional symplectic manifold $\tilde{M}\supset M$ and a
smooth Hamilton function $H: \tilde{M}\to \mathbb R$ such that for some $c\in
\mathbb R$ one gets $M = \{H=c\}$ and the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$
restricted on this level coincides with $X$. For divergence free vector fields
with singular points such the extension is impossible but the existence of
local cross-section allows one to reduce the dynamics to the study of
symplectic diffeomorphisms in some sub-domains of $M$. We also consider the
case of a divergence free vector field $X$ with a smooth integral having only
finite number of critical levels. It is shown that such a noncritical level is
always a 2-torus and restriction of $X$ on it possesses a smooth invariant
2-form. The linearization of the flow on such a torus (i.e. the reduction to
the constant vector field) is not always possible in contrast to the case of an
integrable Hamiltonian system but in the analytic case ($M$ and $X$ are real
analytic), due to the Kolmogorov theorem, such the linearization is possible
for tori with Diophantine rotation numbers.
","On interrelations between divergence-free and Hamiltonian dynamics, we find that a pair of interactions, if one is continuous and the other is non-continuous, is responsible for a divergence of the two interactions. The nonconsistently variable response to the interaction may result from the fact that the interactions (or interactions in this case) are in a noncontinuum, whereas the correlation between the nonconvection and its variable is determined by the relative correlation involved in the cross-sections of its covariance domain when the difference in covariant variables is significant. Indeed, the relationship between interdependencies (i.e., the variables that are at their constant noninference) may depend on whether there is a ""free-equivalence"", a state in which their differences at constant covmean are the same between those between them. Therefore, a relationship of dependence can hold when one encounters a covariation between its constant and noncoherent variable: when there are independent-variant interactions among the three interdependent states of each interindependent state, then those interactions are necessary to ensure an equilibrium state of this interependence",0.24819138647271652,0.2053571378970027,0.1578661526479854

  Reconstruction Technique","  This paper considers the beamspace channel estimation problem in 3D lens
antenna array under a millimeter-wave communication system. We analyze the
focusing capability of the 3D lens antenna array and the sparsity of the
beamspace channel response matrix. Considering the analysis, we observe that
the channel matrix can be treated as a 2D natural image; that is, the channel
is sparse, and the changes between adjacent elements are subtle. Thus, for the
channel estimation, we incorporate an image reconstruction technique called
sparse non-informative parameter estimator-based cosparse analysis AMP for
imaging (SCAMPI) algorithm. The SCAMPI algorithm is faster and more accurate
than earlier algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit and support
detection algorithms. To further improve the SCAMPI algorithm, we model the
channel distribution as a generic Gaussian mixture (GM) probability and embed
the expectation maximization learning algorithm into the SCAMPI algorithm to
learn the parameters in the GM probability. We show that the GM probability
outperforms the common uniform distribution used in image reconstruction. We
also propose a phase-shifter-reduced selection network structure to decrease
the power consumption of the system and prove that the SCAMPI algorithm is
robust even if the number of phase shifters is reduced by 10%.

"Texture zeroes and discrete flavor symmetries in light and heavy
  Majorana neutrino mass matrices: a bottom-up approach","  Texture zeroes in neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ may give us hints about the
symmetries involved in neutrino mass generation. We examine the viability of
such texture zeroes in a model independent way through a bottom-up approach.
Using constraints from the neutrino oscillation data, we develop an analytic
framework that can identify these symmetries and quantify deviations from them.
We analyze the textures of $M_\nu$ as well as those of $M_M$, the mass matrix
of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the context of Type-I seesaw. We point out how
the viability of textures depends on the absolute neutrino mass scale, the
neutrino mass ordering and the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. We also examine the
compatibility of discrete flavor symmetries like $\mu$--$\tau$ exchange and
$S_3$ permutation with the current data. We show that the $\mu-\tau$ exchange
symmetry for $M_\nu$ can be satisfied for any value of the absolute neutrino
mass, but for $M_\nu$ to satisfy the $S_3$ symmetry, neutrino masses have to be
quasi-degenerate. On the other hand, both these symmetries are currently
allowed for $M_M$ for all values of absolute neutrino mass and both mass
orderings.

Performance verification of the CMS Phase-1 Upgrade Pixel detector,"  The CMS tracker consists of two tracking systems utilizing semiconductor
technology: the inner pixel and the outer strip detectors. The tracker
detectors occupy the volume around the beam interaction region between 3 cm and
110 cm in radius and up to 280 cm along the beam axis. The pixel detector
consists of 124 million pixels, corresponding to about 2 m$^{2}$ total area. It
plays a vital role in the seeding of the track reconstruction algorithms and in
the reconstruction of primary interactions and secondary decay vertices. It is
surrounded by the strip tracker with 10 million read-out channels,
corresponding to 200 m$^{2}$ total area. The tracker is operated in a
high-occupancy and high-radiation environment established by particle
collisions in the LHC. The performance of the silicon strip detector continues
to be of high quality. The pixel detector that has been used in Run 1 and in
the first half of Run 2 was, however, replaced with the so-called Phase-1
Upgrade detector. The new system is better suited to match the increased
instantaneous luminosity the LHC would reach before 2023. It was built to
operate at an instantaneous luminosity of around
2$\times$10$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The detector's new layout has an
additional inner layer with respect to the previous one; it allows for more
efficient tracking with smaller fake rate at higher event pile-up. The paper
focuses on the first results obtained during the commissioning of the new
detector. It also includes challenges faced during the first data taking to
reach the optimal measurement efficiency. Details will be given on the
performance at high occupancy with respect to observables such as data-rate,
hit reconstruction efficiency, and resolution.

The use of NPNs is a major contributor to their success. NGP is one of several approaches offered to validate the design of a CMOS detector for the detection and correction of CMONOMIC (Cumulative Noop Noise) with other CMOR components. The use and implementation of sensors and components that are part of our development process are not unique to NPI, but for other sensor architectures have been applied to the whole of GIGABYTE, the Krait and CMOMO designs by others as well as others. This means that any sensor model that is to be used on an OEM will have a higher-res image quality (and hence reliability, for most applications) as a component that has more to do with its own development and development efforts. A few reasons will justify such an increase of sensor quality: 1.

Deciphering mRNA Sequence Determinants of Protein Production Rate,"  One of the greatest challenges in biophysical models of translation is to
identify coding sequences features that affect the rate of translation and
therefore the overall protein production in the cell. We propose an analytic
method to solve a translation model based on the inhomogeneous totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process, which allows us to unveil simple design
principles of nucleotide sequences determining protein production rates. Our
solution shows an excellent agreement when compared to numerical genome-wide
simulations of S. cerevisiae transcript sequences and predicts that the first
10 codons, together with the value of the initiation rate, are the main
determinants of protein production rate. Finally, we interpret the obtained
analytic results based on the evolutionary role of codons' choice for
regulating translation rates and ribosome densities.

Astrometric orbit of a low-mass companion to an ultracool dwarf,"  Little is known about the existence of extrasolar planets around ultracool
dwarfs. Furthermore, binary stars with Sun-like primaries and very low-mass
binaries composed of ultracool dwarfs show differences in the distributions of
mass ratio and orbital separation that can be indicative of distinct formation
mechanisms. Using FORS2/VLT optical imaging for high precision astrometry we
are searching for planets and substellar objects around ultracool dwarfs to
investigate their multiplicity properties for very low companion masses. Here
we report astrometric measurements with an accuracy of two tenths of a
milli-arcsecond over two years that reveal orbital motion of the nearby L1.5
dwarf DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 located at 20.77 +/- 0.08 pc caused by an unseen
companion that revolves about its host on an eccentric orbit in 246.4 +/- 1.4
days. We estimate the L1.5 dwarf to have 7.5 +/- 0.7 % of the Sun's mass that
implies a companion mass of 28 +/- 2 Jupiter masses. This new system has the
smallest mass ratio (0.36 +/- 0.02) of known very low-mass binaries with
characterised orbits. With this discovery we demonstrate 200 micro-arcsecond
astrometry over an arc-minute field and over several years that is sufficient
to discover sub-Jupiter mass planets around ultracool dwarfs. We also show that
the achieved parallax accuracy of < 0.4 % makes it possible to remove distance
as a dominant source of uncertainty in the modelling of ultracool dwarfs.

Parallel Working-Set Search Structures,"  In this paper we present two versions of a parallel working-set map on p
processors that supports searches, insertions and deletions. In both versions,
the total work of all operations when the map has size at least p is bounded by
the working-set bound, i.e., the cost of an item depends on how recently it was
accessed (for some linearization): accessing an item in the map with recency r
takes O(1+log r) work. In the simpler version each map operation has O((log
p)^2+log n) span (where n is the maximum size of the map). In the pipelined
version each map operation on an item with recency r has O((log p)^2+log r)
span. (Operations in parallel may have overlapping span; span is additive only
for operations in sequence.)
  Both data structures are designed to be used by a dynamic multithreading
parallel program that at each step executes a unit-time instruction or makes a
data structure call. To achieve the stated bounds, the pipelined data structure
requires a weak-priority scheduler, which supports a limited form of 2-level
prioritization. At the end we explain how the results translate to practical
implementations using work-stealing schedulers.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parallel implementation of a
self-adjusting search structure where the cost of an operation adapts to the
access sequence. A corollary of the working-set bound is that it achieves work
static optimality: the total work is bounded by the access costs in an optimal
static search tree.

2005 November, at the time of the SDSS observations of the region. (3) 2MASS
02325605+7246055, a low-mass embedded young star, associated with a fan-shaped
infrared nebula, underwent an outburst between the DSS1 and DSS2 surveys,
leading to the appearance of a faint optical nebula. Our [SII] and H alpha
images, as well as the Spitzer IRAC 4.5 micron images revealed Herbig-Haro
objects associated with this star. Our results suggest that amplitudes and time

the stars.

On two conjectures of Maurer concerning basis graphs of matroids,"  We characterize 2-dimensional complexes associated canonically with basis
graphs of matroids as simply connected triangle-square complexes satisfying
some local conditions. This proves a version of a (disproved) conjecture by
Stephen Maurer (Conjecture 3 of S. Maurer, Matroid basis graphs I, JCTB 14

redundancy of the conditions in the characterization of basis graphs. We
indicate positive-curvature-like aspects of the local properties of the studied
complexes. We characterize similarly the corresponding 2-dimensional complexes
of even $\Delta$-matroids.
","On two conjectures of Maurer concerning basis graphs of matroids on the surface, we consider the latter as possible from the point of view of the theory of natural graphs; but the difference that we can make which makes this inference possible by matures is in relation to the nature of these graphs.

Angular momentum evolution for galaxies in a Lambda-CDM scenario,"  Galaxy formation in the current cosmological paradigm is a very complex
process in which inflows, outflows, interactions and mergers are common events.
These processes can redistribute the angular momentum content of baryons.
Recent observational results suggest that disc formed conserving angular
momentum while elliptical galaxies, albeit losing angular momentum, determine a
correlation between the specific angular momentum of the galaxy and the stellar
mass. These observations provide stringent constraints for galaxy formation
models in a hierarchical clustering scenario. We aim to analyse the specific
angular momentum content of the disc and bulge components as a function of
virial mass, stellar mass and redshift. We also estimate the size of the
simulated galaxies and confront them with observations. We use cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations that include an effective, physically-motivated
Supernova feedback which is able to regulate the star formation in haloes of
different masses. We analyse the morphology and formation history of a sample
of galaxies in a cosmological simulation by performing a bulge-disc
decomposition of the analysed systems and their progenitors. We estimate the
angular momentum content of the stellar and gaseous discs, stellar bulges and
total baryons. In agreement with recent observational findings, our simulated
galaxies have disc and spheroid components whose specific angular momentum
contents determine correlations with the stellar and dark matter masses with
the same slope, although the spheroidal components are off-set by a fixed
fraction. Abridged.
","Angular momentum evolution for galaxies in a Lambda-CDM scenario is a factor in the strength of our estimates of gravitational field strength. Therefore, a generalization of the estimate would require that the observed gravitational forces should depend on the direction of gravity change in these regions. The result is that this estimate is not correct, suggesting that massless galaxies are significantly weaker than other light-years (and beyond), despite the lack of any apparent evidence of mass loss from our model. We suggest, therefore, that our uncertainties in this work are more than likely limited to a slight increase due to the low estimates made here. Instead, it is the increase in our sensitivity of these estimates that makes them important and significant because they show the same general behavior across all galaxies of comparable mass, and as a result of a higher sensitivity. Furthermore, we have taken the approach of evaluating the effects of different mass models, including some based on Higgs bosons (that does not include those from the supermassive black holes found here), for such a low sensitivity to mass losses when the models are not so well-tested.""

"Kelvin--Helmholtz instability in a cool solar jet in the framework of
  Hall magnetohydrodynamics: A case study","  We investigate the conditions under which the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes
in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube moving along its axis become unstable
against the Kelvin--Helmholtz (KH) instability. We \textbf{use} the dispersion
relations of MHD modes \textbf{obtained} from the linearized Hall MHD equations
for cool (zero beta) plasma \textbf{by assuming} real wave numbers and complex
angular wave frequencies\textbf{/complex wave phase velocities}. The dispersion
equations are solved numerically at fixed input parameters and varying values
of the ratio $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, where $l_\mathrm{Hall} =
c/\omega_\mathrm{pi}$ ($c$ being the speed of light, and $\omega_\mathrm{pi}$
the ion plasma frequency) and $a$ is the flux tube radius. It is shown that the
stability of the MHD modes depends upon four parameters: the density contrast
between the flux tube and its environment, the ratio of external and internal
magnetic fields, the ratio $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, and the value of the Alfv\'en
Mach number \textbf{defined as the ratio of the tube axial velocity to Alfv\'en
speed inside the flux tube}. It is found that at high density contrasts, for
small values of $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, the kink ($m = 1$) mode can become
unstable against KH instability at some critical Alfv\'en Mach number (or
equivalently at critical flow speed), but a threshold $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$ can
suppress the onset of the KH instability. At small density contrasts, however,
the magnitude of $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$ does not affect noticeably the condition
for instability occurrence---even though it can reduce the critical Alfv\'en
Mach number. It is established that the sausage mode ($m = 0$) is not subject
to the KH instability.

Conduction through 71o domain walls in BiFeO3 thin films,"  Local conduction at domains and domains walls is investigated in BiFeO3 thin
films containing mostly 71o domain walls. Measurements at room temperature
reveal conduction through 71o domain walls. Conduction through domains could
also be observed at high enough temperatures. It is found that, despite the
lower conductivity of the domains, both are governed by the same mechanisms: in
the low voltage regime electrons trapped at defect states are
temperature-activated but the current is limited by the ferroelectric surface
charges; in the large voltage regime, Schottky emission takes place and the
role of oxygen vacancies is that of selectively increasing the Fermi energy at
the walls and locally reducing the Schottky barrier. This understanding
provides the key to engineering conduction paths in oxides.
","Conduction through 71o domain walls in BiFeO3 thin films is done using both DPP and DPLA. The DPS (decrease or decrease of a chemical bond) of the 2d layer is measured. This is accomplished using a photodiode (5D) and dendrites used along with a low field flux transistor.

"A general method to construct cube-like categories and applications to
  homotopy theory","  In this paper, we introduce a method to construct new categories which look
like ""cubes"", and discuss model structures on the presheaf categories over
them. First, we introduce a notion of thin-powered structure on small
categories, which provides a generalized notion of ""power-sets"" on categories.
Next, we see that if a small category $\mathcal{R}$ admits a good thin-powered
structure, we can construct a new category $\square(\mathcal{R})$ called the
cubicalization of the category. We also see that $\square(\mathcal{R})$ is
equipped with enough structures so that many arguments made for the classical
cube category $\square$ are also available. In particular, it is a test
category in the sense of Grothendieck. The resulting categories contain the
cube category $\square$, the cube category with connections $\square^c$, the
extended cubical category $\square_\Sigma$ introduced by Isaacson, and cube
categories $\square_G$ symmetrized by more general group operads $G$. We
finally discuss model structures on the presheaf categories
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ over cubicalizations. We prove that
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ admits a model structure such that the simplicial
realization $\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge\to SSet$ is a left Quillen functor.
Moreover, in the case of $\square_G$ for group operads $G$, $\square^\wedge_G$
is a monoidal model category, and we have a sequence of monoidal Quillen
equivalences $\square Set \to \square_G^\wedge\to SSet$. For example, if $G=B$
is the group operad consisting of braid groups, the category $\square^\wedge_B$
is a braided monoidal model category whose homotopy category is equivalent to
that of $SSet$.

"Genomic and phenotypic characterisation of a wild Medaka population:
  Establishing an isogenic population genetic resource in fish","  Background Oryzias latipes (Medaka) has been established as a vertebrate
genetic model for over a century, and has recently been rediscovered outside
its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to
reinvigorate Medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic
panel derived from a single wild population. Results Here we characterise the
genomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese
population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic
panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental
population structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties
suitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric
traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will
be feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of
these Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of
geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little
significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population
since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that
the Southern Japanese Medaka existed as a larger older population which went
through a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we
detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population.
Conclusions These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu Medaka
samples are suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel
and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.

On the expressive power of read-once determinants,"  We introduce and study the notion of read-$k$ projections of the determinant:
a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is called a {\it read-$k$
projection of determinant} if $f=det(M)$, where entries of matrix $M$ are
either field elements or variables such that each variable appears at most $k$
times in $M$. A monomial set $S$ is said to be expressible as read-$k$
projection of determinant if there is a read-$k$ projection of determinant $f$
such that the monomial set of $f$ is equal to $S$. We obtain basic results
relating read-$k$ determinantal projections to the well-studied notion of
determinantal complexity. We show that for sufficiently large $n$, the $n
\times n$ permanent polynomial $Perm_n$ and the elementary symmetric
polynomials of degree $d$ on $n$ variables $S_n^d$ for $2 \leq d \leq n-2$ are
not expressible as read-once projection of determinant, whereas $mon(Perm_n)$
and $mon(S_n^d)$ are expressible as read-once projections of determinant. We
also give examples of monomial sets which are not expressible as read-once
projections of determinant.

"Decoupling Jupiter's deep and atmospheric flows using the upcoming Juno
  gravity measurements and a dynamical inverse model","  Observations of the flow on Jupiter exists essentially only for the
cloud-level, which is dominated by strong east-west jet-streams. These have
been suggested to result from dynamics in a superficial thin weather-layer, or
alternatively be a manifestation of deep interior cylindrical flows. However,
it is possible that the observed winds are indeed superficial, yet there exists
deep flow that is completely decoupled from it. To date, all models linking the
wind, via the induced density anomalies, to the gravity field, to be measured
by Juno, consider only flow that is a projection of the observed could-level
wind. Here we explore the possibility of complex wind dynamics that include
both the shallow weather-layer wind, and a deep flow that is decoupled from the
flow above it. The upper flow is based on the observed cloud-level flow and is
set to decay with depth. The deep flow is constructed to produce cylindrical
structures with variable width and magnitude, thus allowing for a wide range of
possible scenarios for the unknown deep flow. The combined flow is then related
to the density anomalies and gravitational moments via a dynamical model. An
adjoint inverse model is used for optimizing the parameters controlling the
setup of the deep and surface-bound flows, so that these flows can be
reconstructed given a gravity field. We show that the model can be used for
examination of various scenarios, including cases in which the deep flow is
dominating over the surface wind. We discuss extensively the uncertainties
associated with the model solution. The flexibility of the adjoint method
allows for a wide range of dynamical setups, so that when new observations and
physical understanding will arise, these constraints could be easily
implemented and used to better decipher Jupiter flow dynamics.
","Decoupling Jupiter's deep and atmospheric flows using the upcoming Juno
  gravity measurements and a dynamical inverse model show that the gravity is not at work, suggesting a new and important feature of the water-gravitation event known as Io in the near Pacific. The event's gravity-movability is similar enough for Jovian expansion to have occurred, but some authors (Woltsonian astronomers) believe that it is only possible at a fraction of Jupiter's gravitational volume.

The first observations of Io were made on 18 November 2009. On 24 December 2009, scientists from the University of Glasgow and the UK's Centre for Astrophysics and Astronomy performed a series of observations that showed that Io'is extremely rich in ionospheric gas. At the same time, the gravitational pressure on the surface of Europa was high enough to create a'shock effect'. A 'dynamic inverse' model of this event suggested that one source of current gravity in Io might be a massive Jupiter-type plasma. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in detail in our current knowledge. Instead, a combination of high-performance supercomputer modeling and modeling technology are required and with the help of a gravitational simulation with an inverse-normalisation. Here we show the impact of these gravitational simulations on JOV's core's water temperature at Jupiter and how the tidal forces exerted by Io may cause it to fall so that water is trapped in",0.29242369182535416,0.23300970374043015,0.20703978125628963

"Separating timing, movement conditions and individual differences in the
  analysis of human movement","  A central task in the analysis of human movement behavior is to determine
systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions,
participants and repetitions. This is possible because human movement is highly
regular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and
movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating
variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a
well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms
of preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear
mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain
systematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path
relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which
the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation
found in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm
movements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location
while avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data
according to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes
nonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis
frameworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that
estimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the
task demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions
of movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle
placement and height on the movement path. We demonstrate that the approach can
be used to uncover new properties of human movement.

"Efficient coupling between dielectric waveguide modes and exterior
  plasmon whispering gallery modes","  Inefficient coupling between dielectric guided mode and plasmon mode has been
overlooked in the past. The mechanism in it is essentially different from the
conventional coupling between dielectric modes. Based on qualitative
theoretical analysis, we proposed two methods to strengthen the coupling
between dielectric waveguide modes and exterior plasmon whispering gallery
modes. One is using a U-shaped bent waveguide to break the adiabatic mode
conversion process, and the other is to render the dielectric mode of
higher-order to reach phase matching with plasmon mode. Both the transmission
spectrum of waveguide and the energy spectrum of cavity demonstrate that the
coupling efficiencies can be greatly improved. These simple configurations are
potential for wide applications, for example, tunable integrated optical
devices, nanolasers and sensors.

"Asymptotic behaviors of representations of graded categories with
  inductive functors","  In this paper we describe an inductive machinery to investigate asymptotic
behaviors of homology groups and related invariants of representations of
certain graded combinatorial categories over a commutative Noetherian ring $k$,
via introducing inductive functors which generalize important properties of
shift functors of $\mathrm{FI}$-modules. In particular, a sufficient criterion
for finiteness of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of finitely generated
representations of these categories is obtained. As applications, we show that
a few important infinite combinatorial categories appearing in representation
stability theory are equipped with inductive functors, and hence the finiteness
of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of their finitely generated representations
is guaranteed. We also prove that truncated representations of these categories
have linear minimal resolutions by relative projective modules, which are
precisely linear minimal projective resolutions when $k$ is a field of
characteristic 0.
","Asymptotic behaviors of representations of graded categories with
  inductive functors can be considered a type classifier: the more inductively, the better it is at finding the best representation of an abstract language (e.g., when the language is not explicitly a language), but only once.

the mechanical energy is controlled by the damping coefficient. We show that in
the limit of vanishing damping a stochastic analogue of the equipartition
theorem can be proposed, namely the statistical properties of potential and
kinetic energies attain distributions characterized by the same width. Finally,
we demonstrate that the ratio of instantaneous kinetic and potential energies
which signifies departure from the mechanical energy equipartition, follows
universal power-law asymptotics.

"Crucible aperture: an effective way to reduce source oxidation in oxide
  molecular beam epitaxy process","  Growing multi-elemental complex-oxide structures using an MBE (Molecular Beam
Epitaxy) technique requires precise control of each source flux. However, when
the component elements have significantly different oxygen affinities,
maintaining stable fluxes for easily oxidizing elements is challenging because
of a source oxidation problem. Here, using Sr as a test source, we show that a
crucible aperture insert scheme significantly reduces the source oxidation in
an oxide-MBE environment. The crucible aperture insert was shaped like a disk
with a hole at the center and was mounted inside the crucible; it blocks most
of the oxygen species coming to the source, thus reducing the source oxidation.
However, the depth of the aperture disk was critical for its performance; an
ill-positioned aperture could make the flux stability even worse. With an
optimally positioned aperture insert, the crucible exhibited more than four
times improvement in Sr flux stability, compared to a conventional,
non-apertured crucible.

"Characterization of Infrared Dark Clouds -- NH$_3$ Observations of an
  Absorption-contrast Selected IRDC Sample","  Despite increasing research in massive star formation, little is known about
its earliest stages. Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense and massive
enough to harbour the sites of future high-mass star formation. But up to now,
mainly small samples have been observed and analysed. To understand the
physical conditions during the early stages of high-mass star formation, it is
necessary to learn more about the physical conditions and stability in
relatively unevolved IRDCs. Thus, for characterising IRDCs studies of large
samples are needed. We investigate a complete sample of 218 northern hemisphere
high-contrast IRDCs using the ammonia (1,1)- and (2,2)-inversion transitions.
We detected ammonia (1,1)-inversion transition lines in 109 of our IRDC
candidates. Using the data we were able to study the physical conditions within
the star-forming regions statistically. We compared them with the conditions in
more evolved regions which have been observed in the same fashion as our sample
sources. Our results show that IRDCs have, on average, rotation temperatures of
15 K, are turbulent (with line width FWHMs around 2 km s$^{-1}$), have ammonia
column densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and molecular hydrogen
column densities on the order of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Their virial masses are
between 100 and a few 1000 M$_\odot$. The comparison of bulk kinetic and
potential energies indicate that the sources are close to virial equilibrium.
IRDCs are on average cooler and less turbulent than a comparison sample of
high-mass protostellar objects, and have lower ammonia column densities. Virial
parameters indicate that the majority of IRDCs are currently stable, but are
expected to collapse in the future.

Cavity-Enhanced Rayleigh Scattering,"  We demonstrate Purcell-like enhancement of Rayleigh scattering into a single
optical mode of a Fabry-Perot resonator for several thermal atomic and
molecular gases. The light is detuned by more than an octave, in this case by
hundreds of nanometers, from any optical transition, making particle excitation
and spontaneous emission negligible. The enhancement of light scattering into
the resonator is explained quantitatively as an interference effect of light
waves emitted by a classical driven dipole oscillator. Applications of our
method include the sensitive, non-destructive in-situ detection of ultracold
molecules.

"Geodesic orbit metrics in compact homogeneous manifolds with equivalent
  isotropy submodules","  A geodesic orbit manifold (GO manifold) is a Riemannian manifold (M,g) with
the property that any geodesic in M is an orbit of a one-parameter subgroup of
a group G of isometries of (M,g). The metric g is then called a G-GO metric in
M. For an arbitrary compact homogeneous manifold M=G/H, we simplify the general
problem of determining the G-GO metrics in M. In particular, if the isotropy
representation of H induces equivalent irreducible submodules in the tangent
space of M, we obtain algebraic conditions, under which, any G-GO metric in M
admits a reduced form. As an application we determine the U(n)-GO metrics in
the complex Stiefel manifolds V_k(C^n).

A Propagation Model for Provenance Views of Public/Private Workflows,"  We study the problem of concealing functionality of a proprietary or private
module when provenance information is shown over repeated executions of a
workflow which contains both `public' and `private' modules. Our approach is to
use `provenance views' to hide carefully chosen subsets of data over all
executions of the workflow to ensure G-privacy: for each private module and
each input x, the module's output f(x) is indistinguishable from G -1 other
possible values given the visible data in the workflow executions. We show that
G-privacy cannot be achieved simply by combining solutions for individual
private modules; data hiding must also be `propagated' through public modules.
We then examine how much additional data must be hidden and when it is safe to
stop propagating data hiding. The answer depends strongly on the workflow
topology as well as the behavior of public modules on the visible data. In
particular, for a class of workflows (which include the common tree and chain
workflows), taking private solutions for each private module, augmented with a
`public closure' that is `upstream-downstream safe', ensures G-privacy. We
define these notions formally and show that the restrictions are necessary. We
also study the related optimization problems of minimizing the amount of hidden
data.

"The abundances of hydrocarbon functional groups in the interstellar
  medium inferred from laboratory spectra of hydrogenated and methylated
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","  Infrared (IR) absorption spectra of individual polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing methyl (-CH3), methylene (>CH2), or diamond-like
*CH groups and IR spectra of mixtures of methylated and hydrogenated PAHs
prepared by gas phase condensation were measured at room temperature (as grains
in pellets) and at low temperature (isolated in Ne matrices). In addition, the
PAH blends were subjected to an in-depth molecular structure analysis by means
of high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry. Supported by calculations at the density functional theory
level, the laboratory results were applied to analyze in detail the aliphatic
absorption complex of the diffuse interstellar medium at 3.4 mu-m and to
determine the abundances of hydrocarbon functional groups. Assuming that the
PAHs are mainly locked in grains, aliphatic CHx groups (x = 1,2,3) would
contribute approximately in equal quantities to the 3.4 mu-m feature (N_{CHx} /
N_{H} approx 10^{-5} - 2 * 10^{-5}). The abundances, however, may be two to
four times lower if a major contribution to the 3.4 mu-m feature comes from
molecules in the gas phase. Aromatic =CH groups seem to be almost absent from
some lines of sight, but can be nearly as abundant as each of the aliphatic
components in other directions (N_{=CH} / N_{H} < 2 * 10^{-5}; upper value for
grains). Due to comparatively low binding energies, astronomical IR emission
sources do not display such heavy excess hydrogenation. At best, especially in
proto-planetary nebulae, >CH2 groups bound to aromatic molecules, i.e., excess
hydrogens on the molecular periphery only, can survive the presence of a nearby
star.

Structure of the nucleon's low-lying excitations,"  A continuum approach to the three valence-quark bound-state problem in
quantum field theory is used to perform a comparative study of the four
lightest $(I=1/2,J^P = 1/2^\pm)$ baryon isospin-doublets in order to elucidate
their structural similarities and differences. Such analyses predict the
presence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)
correlations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,
isovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all
play a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and
pseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame
wave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in
this $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground
state. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:
accurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector
diquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark
cores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the
associated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess
measurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state in each
negative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In
quantum field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity
channels must owe to chiral symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly
dynamical in the light-quark sector. Consequently, experiments that can
validate the contrasts drawn herein between the structure of the four lightest
$(1/2,1/2^\pm)$ doublets will prove valuable in testing links between emergent
mass generation and observable phenomena and, plausibly, thereby revealing
dynamical features of confinement.

In recent years, we have built a small but sensitive instrument called a laser (Fig. 1). This instrument has an extremely low wavelength and much higher energy absorption than our optical instruments and allows us to detect even very faint emission signals. It does, however, have one serious problem: The detector in the laser is very sensitive to any of three kinds of emission. Here one of those emission types comes from a high-frequency, high voltage source. We used the Fractionum laser to measure the higher frequency of each of these emitters: the K-dims, the M-cads, and Mp-curves -- the ones that have a longer wavelength (see Fig. 5). Thus far, most of them have been studied as single-dimensional particles in a vacuum. In fact, all the molecules with one wavelength can be clearly identified. But we now have the ability to identify those molecules and to map them into small single structures.

Rational Normal Scrolls and the Defining Equations of Rees Algebras,"  Consider a height two ideal,
  $I$, which is minimally generated by $m$ homogeneous forms of degree $d$ in
the polynomial ring $R=k[x,y]$. Suppose that one column in the homogeneous
presenting matrix $\f$ of $I$ has entries of degree $n$ and all of the other
entries of $\f$ are linear. We identify an explicit generating set for the
ideal $\Cal A$ which defines the Rees algebra $\Cal R=R[It]$; so $\Cal R=S/\Cal
A$ for the polynomial ring $S=R[T_1,...,T_m]$. We resolve $\Cal R$ as an
$S$-module and $I^s$ as an $R$-module, for all powers $s$. The proof uses the
homogeneous coordinate ring, $A=S/H$, of a rational normal scroll, with
$H\subseteq \Cal A$. The ideal $\Cal AA$ is isomorphic to the $n^{\text{th}}$
symbolic power of a height one prime ideal $K$ of $A$. The ideal $K^{(n)}$ is
generated by monomials. Whenever possible, we study $A/K^{(n)}$ in place of
$A/\Cal AA$ because the generators of $K^{(n)}$ are much less complicated then
the generators of $\Cal AA$. We obtain a filtration of $K^{(n)}$ in which the
factors are polynomial rings, hypersurface rings, or modules resolved by
generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes. The generators of $I$ parameterize an
algebraic curve $\Cal C$ in projective $m-1$ space. The defining equations of
the special fiber ring $\Cal R/(x,y)\Cal R$ yield a solution of the
implicitization problem for $\Cal C$.

Anecdotal evidence suggests these books have several important implications for the role of language in the development of life; it provides insight into these key elements of a normal character in life and leads us to look further into the relationship between religion and language as an area of study.

Random Matrices and Chaos in Nuclear Physics: Nuclear Reactions,"  The application of random-matrix theory (RMT) to compound-nucleus (CN)
reactions is reviewed. An introduction into the basic concepts of nuclear
scattering theory is followed by a survey of phenomenological approaches to CN
scattering. The implementation of a random-matrix approach into scattering
theory leads to a statistical theory of CN reactions. Since RMT applies
generically to chaotic quantum systems, that theory is, at the same time, a
generic theory of quantum chaotic scattering. It uses a minimum of input
parameters (average S-matrix and mean level spacing of the CN). Predictions of
the theory are derived with the help of field-theoretical methods adapted from
condensed-matter physics and compared with those of phenomenological
approaches. Thorough tests of the theory are reviewed, as are applications in
nuclear physics, with special attention given to violation of symmetries
(isospin, parity) and time-reversal invariance.

Some classes of topological quasi *-algebras,"  The completion $\overline{A}[\tau]$ of a locally convex *-algebra $A [ \tau
]$ with not jointly continuous multiplication is a *-vector space with partial
multiplication $xy$ defined only for $x$ or $y \in A_{0}$, and it is called a
topological quasi *-algebra. In this paper two classes of topological quasi
*-algebras called strict CQ$^*$-algebras and HCQ$^*$-algebras are studied.
Roughly speaking, a strict CQ$^*$-algebra (resp. HCQ$^*$-algebra) is a Banach
(resp. Hilbert) quasi *-algebra containing a C$^*$-algebra endowed with another
involution $\sharp$ and C$^*$-norm $\| \|_{\sharp}$. HCQ$^*$-algebras are
closely related to left Hilbert algebras. We shall show that a Hilbert space is
a HCQ$^*$-algebra if and only if it contains a left Hilbert algebra with unit
as a dense subspace. Further, we shall give a necessary and sufficient
condition under which a strict CQ$^*$-algebra is embedded in a HCQ$^*$-algebra.

Ortho-to-para ratio of interstellar heavy water,"  Despite the low elemental deuterium abundance in the Galaxy, enhanced
molecular D/H ratios have been found in the environments of low-mass star

CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program aims at
studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high
sensitivity and spectral resolution of the HIFI instrument provide a unique
opportunity to observe the fundamental 1,1,1 - 0,0,0 transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule, inaccessible from the ground, and to determine the
ortho-to-para D2O ratio. We have detected the fundamental transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule at 607.35 GHz towards IRAS 16293-2422. The line is seen in
absorption with a line opacity of 0.62 +/- 0.11 (1 sigma). From the previous
ground-based observations of the fundamental 1,1,0 - 1,0,1 transition of
para-D2O seen in absorption at 316.80 GHz we estimate a line opacity of 0.26
+/- 0.05 (1 sigma). We show that the observed absorption is caused by the cold
gas in the envelope of the protostar. Using these new observations, we estimate
for the first time the ortho to para D2O ratio to be lower than 2.6 at a 3
sigma level of uncertainty, to be compared with the thermal equilibrium value
of 2:1.

Self-Calibrated Cluster Counts as a Probe of Primordial Non-Gaussianity,"  We show that the ability to probe primordial non-Gaussianity with cluster
counts is drastically improved by adding the excess variance of counts which
contains information on the clustering. The conflicting dependences of changing
the mass threshold and including primordial non-Gaussianity on the mass
function and biasing indicate that the self-calibrated cluster counts well
break the degeneracy between primordial non-Gaussianity and the observable-mass
relation. Based on the Fisher matrix analysis, we show that the count variance
improves constraints on f_NL by more than an order of magnitude. It exhibits
little degeneracy with dark energy equation of state. We forecast that upcoming
Hyper Suprime-cam cluster surveys and Dark Energy Survey will constrain
primordial non-Gaussianity at the level \sigma(f_NL) \sim 8, which is

On the Local Minima of the Empirical Risk,"  Population risk is always of primary interest in machine learning; however,
learning algorithms only have access to the empirical risk. Even for
applications with nonconvex nonsmooth losses (such as modern deep networks),
the population risk is generally significantly more well-behaved from an
optimization point of view than the empirical risk. In particular, sampling can
create many spurious local minima. We consider a general framework which aims
to optimize a smooth nonconvex function $F$ (population risk) given only access
to an approximation $f$ (empirical risk) that is pointwise close to $F$ (i.e.,
$\|F-f\|_{\infty} \le \nu$). Our objective is to find the
$\epsilon$-approximate local minima of the underlying function $F$ while
avoiding the shallow local minima---arising because of the tolerance
$\nu$---which exist only in $f$. We propose a simple algorithm based on
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a smoothed version of $f$ that is
guaranteed to achieve our goal as long as $\nu \le O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$. We
also provide an almost matching lower bound showing that our algorithm achieves
optimal error tolerance $\nu$ among all algorithms making a polynomial number
of queries of $f$. As a concrete example, we show that our results can be
directly used to give sample complexities for learning a ReLU unit.
","On the Local Minima of the Empirical Risk

On a practical, technical level, the risk can be considered an ""empirically significant probability"" in a scientific research. In both a theoretical and theoretical context, there is a probability that, with some mathematical or computational improvements, a specific outcome or outcome may be expected from the experiment. As such, empirical probability can help us in distinguishing the probability of different outcomes from one another even before an event becomes evident but before either the initial outcome is known or the conclusion is available. It also helps us to be prepared for unpredictable interactions between events.

"Throughput Analysis of Network Coding in Multi-Hop Wireless Mesh
  Networks Using Queueing Theory","  In recent years, a significant amount of research has been conducted to
explore the benefits of network coding in different scenarios, from both

of successful transmission in terms of collision probability, and feedback
mechanism and retransmission. Regarding the coding process, our model uses a
multi-class queueing network where coded packets are separated from native

quantum dots has been analyzed by means of two different theoretical
approaches: equations of motion for the all orders localized electron
correlation functions, considering interference effects, and kinetic equations
for the pseudo-particle occupation numbers with constraint on the possible
physical states. Results obtained by means of different approaches were
carefully analyzed and compared with each other. Revealed direct link between

"Small-depth Multilinear Formula Lower Bounds for Iterated Matrix
  Multiplication, with Applications","  In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$
many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$, and show that the
well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any
depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.
  Formally, for each depth $\Delta \leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth
$\Delta$ multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have size
$\exp(\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})).$ It also follows from this that any
multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ for the same polynomial of the
above form must have a size of $\exp(\Omega(d^{1/\Delta})).$ In particular, any
polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth
$\Omega(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for
$\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these
bounds are tight up to constant factors.
  1. Depth-reduction: A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any
formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth
$O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear
formulas. Our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear
setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial
blow-up in size.
  2. Separations from general formulas: Our result, along with a non-trivial
upper bound for $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal
and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth
$\Delta = o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$
cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{\omega(1)}$ and
product-depth $\Delta,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.

Theoretical modeling of matrix functions over the finite-molecule space has been used to provide real-world examples in multiplicity modeling. To develop the new, high-scale, multilevel matrix algorithms for the optimization of complex models, we define the optimal matrix function for linear and stochastic multilayer multidimensional matrix (SMMSM) systems as three dimensional finite elements. The SMMM system can be implemented as a multilevel multigroup system as follows:
""In the matrix 'a' and 'b' the'm' matrix is either matrix or matrix, and is always 0 as in the linear function matrix of a matrix. 'n' is the minimum matrix for this matrix as it does not have a single member for each element. In a linear MMSF, the smallest number of non-zero values is required. Similarly, in a nonlinear multivariable MSSM, if the number is an infinite number, then 't' becomes the maximum matrix value.

Spatial averaging and apparent acceleration in inhomogeneous spaces,"  As an alternative to dark energy that explains the observed acceleration of
the universe, it has been suggested that we may be at the center of an
inhomogeneous isotropic universe described by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB)
solution of Einstein's field equations. To test this possibility, it is
necessary to solve the null geodesics. In this paper we first give a detailed
derivation of a fully analytical set of differential equations for the radial
null geodesics as functions of the redshift in LTB models. As an application we
use these equaions to show that a positive averaged acceleration $a_D$ obtained
in LTB models through spatial averaging can be incompatible with cosmological
observations. We provide examples of LTB models with positive $a_D$ which fail
to reproduce the observed luminosity distance $D_L(z)$. Since the apparent
cosmic acceleration $a^{FLRW}$ is obtained from fitting the observed luminosity
distance to a FLRW model we conclude that in general a positive $a_D$ in LTB
models does not imply a positive $a^{FLRW}$.

The trajectory of light ray under Kerr-Taub-NUT space time,"  According to General Relativity, there are three factors namely mass,
rotation and charge that can influence the path of light ray. Many authors
showed that there is another factor which can influence the path of light ray
namely gravitomagnetism. Here we discuss the effect of a rotating body with
non-zero (Kerr- Taub-NUT) magnetic field on the motion of light ray. We use the
null geodesic of photon method and obtain the deflection angle of light ray for
such a body up to fourth order term in the equatorial plane. Our calculation
shows that magnetism has a noticeable effect on the path of light ray. If we
set the magnetism equal to zero, our expression of bending angle reduces to the
Kerr bending angle. However, we get non-zero bending angle for a hypothetical
mass less, magnetic body.

"The stellar orbit distribution in present-day galaxies inferred from the
  CALIFA survey","  Galaxy formation entails the hierarchical assembly of mass, along with the
condensation of baryons and the ensuing, self-regulating star formation. The
stars form a collisionless system whose orbit distribution retains dynamical
memory that can constrain a galaxy's formation history. The ordered-rotation
dominated orbits with near maximum circularity $\lambda_z \simeq1$ and the
random-motion dominated orbits with low circularity $\lambda_z \simeq0$ are
called kinematically cold and kinematically hot, respectively. The fraction of
stars on `cold' orbits, compared to the fraction of stars on `hot' orbits,
speaks directly to the quiescence or violence of the galaxies' formation
histories. Here we present such orbit distributions, derived from stellar
kinematic maps via orbit-based modelling for a well defined, large sample of
300 nearby galaxies. The sample, drawn from the CALIFA survey, includes the
main morphological galaxy types and spans the total stellar mass range from
$10^{8.7}$ to $10^{11.9}$ solar masses. Our analysis derives the
orbit-circularity distribution as a function of galaxy mass,
$p(\lambda_z~|~M_\star)$, and its volume-averaged total distribution,
$p(\lambda_z)$. We find that across most of the considered mass range and
across morphological types, there are more stars on `warm' orbits defined as
$0.25\le \lambda_z \le 0.8$ than on either `cold' or `hot' orbits. This
orbit-based ""Hubble diagram"" provides a benchmark for galaxy formation
simulations in a cosmological context.
","The stellar orbit distribution in present-day galaxies inferred from the
  CALIFA survey is due to variations in rotation of the disk, particularly in the angular direction, in which regions of motion are less stable, with respect to their orbits within the observed period. Recent advances in galactic astronomy (e.g., in galaxies in our Milky Way galaxy) have made this possible, but the precise magnitude of these variations are still under investigations, and the resolution of observations cannot be directly verified with any specific statistical tool, as has been the case with earlier work and is well known to the layman. We propose that the stellar orbital distribution of Milky Asbri can therefore be determined by two observations on the Milky-Halo region to be very similar to those observed through the CCD imaging at CERN's CMB R15b on May 21, 1994.

{\L}S condition for filled Julia sets in $\mathbb{C}$,"  In this article, we derive an inequality of {\L}ojasiewicz-Siciak type for
certain sets arising in the context of the complex dynamics in dimension 1.
More precisely, if we denote by $dist$ the euclidian distance in $\mathbb{C}$,
we show that the Green function $G_K$ of the filled Julia set $K$ of a
polynomial such that $\mathring{K}\neq \emptyset$ satisfies the so-called {\L}S
condition $\displaystyle G_A\geq c\cdot dist(\cdot, K)^{c'}$ in a neighborhood
of $K$, for some constants $c,c'>0$. Relatively few examples of compact sets
satisfying the {\L}S condition are known. Our result highlights an interesting
class of compact sets fulfilling this condition. The fact that filled Julia

"Laser-like X-ray Sources Based on Optical Reflection from Relativistic
  Electron Mirror","  A novel scheme is proposed to generate uniform relativistic electron layers
for coherent Thomson backscattering. A few-cycle laser pulse is used to produce
the electron layer from an ultra-thin solid foil. The key element of the new
scheme is an additional foil that reflects the drive laser pulse, but lets the
electrons pass almost unperturbed. It is shown by analytic theory and by 2D-PIC
simulation that the electrons, after interacting with both drive and reflected
laser pulse, form a very uniform flyer freely cruising with high relativistic
gamma-factor exactly in drive laser direction (no transverse momentum). It

Anti-Ramsey number of edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees,"  An edge-colored graph $G$ is called rainbow if every edge of $G$ receives a
different color. The anti-Ramsey number of $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning
trees, denoted by $r(n,t)$, is defined as the maximum number of colors in an
edge-coloring of $K_n$ containing no $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees.
Jahanbekam and West [J. Graph Theory, 2014] conjectured that for any fixed $t$,
$r(n,t)=\binom{n-2}{2}+t$ whenever $n\geq 2t+2 \geq 6$. In this paper, we prove
this conjecture. We also determine $r(n,t)$ when $n = 2t+1$. Together with
previous results, this gives the anti-Ramsey number of $t$ edge-disjoint
rainbow spanning trees for all values of $n$ and $t$.

Transition-Based Dependency Parsing with Stack Long Short-Term Memory,"  We propose a technique for learning representations of parser states in
transition-based dependency parsers. Our primary innovation is a new control
structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks---the stack LSTM. Like the
conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements
can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in
addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents.
This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of
a parser's state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words,
(ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the
complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including
their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for
training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.

TYPE II DNA: when the interfacial energy becomes negative,"  An important step in transcription of a DNA base sequence to a protein is the
initiation from the exact starting point, called promoter region. We propose a
physical mechanism for identification of the promoter region, which relies on a
new classification of DNAs into two types, Type-I and Type-II, like
superconductors, depending on the sign of the energy of the interface
separating the zipped and the unzipped phases. This is determined by the
energies of helical ordering and stretching over two independent length scales.
The negative interfacial energy in Type II DNA leads to domains of helically
ordered state separated by defect regions, or blobs, enclosed by the
interfaces. The defect blobs, pinned by non-coding promoter regions, would be
physically distinct from all other types of bubbles. We also show that the
order of the melting transition under a force is different for Type I and Type
II.

It is important to note that the temperature of the hot gas is often not the same as the energy that is released in this process, either, if the heat is being dissipated.

"Recent CMB observations enable to find the total gravitational energy of
  a mass","  The astronomical observations indicate that the universe expands with
acceleration and it has a finite event horizon. The recent CMB observations
confirm the universe is homogeneous, isotropic and asymptotically flat. The
total gravitational energy of a body having mass m is the gravitational
potential energy originating from the gravitational interaction of the body
with all masses of the universe, within the event horizon. The flat geometry of
the universe enables to determine the total gravitational energy of the mass m
within the framework of the Newtonian gravity in Euclidean space. By this
approach, it has been found the modulus of the total gravitational energy of a
body is close to its rest energy E = m*c^2, which is a remarkable result.
Besides, the smoothed gravitational potential in an arbitrary point of the

Intersection patterns of finite sets and of convex sets,"  The main result is a common generalization of results on lower bounds for the
chromatic number of r-uniform hypergraphs and some of the major theorems in
Tverberg-type theory, which is concerned with the intersection pattern of faces
in a simplicial complex when continuously mapped to Euclidean space. As an
application we get a simple proof of a generalization of a result of Kriz for
certain parameters. This specializes to a short and simple proof of Kneser's
conjecture. Moreover, combining this result with recent work of Mabillard and
Wagner we show that the existence of certain equivariant maps yields lower
bounds for chromatic numbers. We obtain an essentially elementary proof of the
result of Schrijver on the chromatic number of stable Kneser graphs. In fact,
we show that every neighborly even-dimensional polytope yields a small induced
subgraph of the Kneser graph of the same chromatic number. We furthermore use
this geometric viewpoint to give tight lower bounds for the chromatic number of
certain small subhypergraphs of Kneser hypergraphs.

"Variability of North Atlantic hurricanes: seasonal versus
  individual-event features","  Tropical cyclones are affected by a large number of climatic factors, which
translates into complex patterns of occurrence. The variability of annual
metrics of tropical-cyclone activity has been intensively studied, in
particular since the sudden activation of the N Atl in the mid 1990's. We
provide first a swift overview on previous work by diverse authors about these
annual metrics for the NAtl basin, where the natural variability of the
phenomenon, the existence of trends, the drawbacks of the records, and the
influence of global warming have been the subject of interesting debates. Next,
we present an alternative approach that does not focus on seasonal features but
on the characteristics of single events [Corral et al Nature Phys 6, 693,
2010]. It is argued that the individual-storm power dissipation index (PDI)
constitutes a natural way to describe each event, and further, that the PDI
statistics yields a robust law for the occurrence of tropical cyclones in terms
of a power law. In this context, methods of fitting these distributions are
discussed. As an important extension to this work we introduce a distribution
function that models the whole range of the PDI density (excluding
incompleteness effects at the smallest values), the gamma distribution,
consisting in a power-law with an exponential decay at the tail. The
characteristic scale of this decay, represented by the cutoff parameter,
provides very valuable information on the finiteness size of the basin, via the
largest values of the PDIs that the basin can sustain. We use the gamma fit to
evaluate the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on the occurrence of
extreme PDI values, for which we find an increase around 50 % in the values of
these basin-wide events for a 0.49 degC SST average difference. ...

  individual-event features

The present work reviews results from the research conducted by researchers at the University of Alberta, including data from different periods of the year. Specifically, the results show that of 14 models of Hurricane Loma, three were more likely to predict the tropical cyclone A1 to have a long cyclonic history than the previous three models ( ). The results also show positive influences on climate of hurricanes. Models of Lomas, which are in the category of tropical hurricanes, are also more realistic with respect to models predicting hurricane intensity. The high level of confidence in a single model was also demonstrated by a model of hurricane landfall. Furthermore, models that are more sensitive to wind direction are likely much more optimistic about their predictions of a hurricane.
- An important part of this research has focused on potential changes in hurricane severity; for example, tropical storm intensity is being observed to be higher than that observed between March and July in all 16 tropical storms observed so far in 2013. To test whether there is a link between observed hurricane activity and an increased risk of tornadoes, this work has been published in J. Meteor. Soc., Vol. 45, Oct. 1, 2014.

Limiting interpolation spaces via extrapolation,"  We give a complete characterization of limiting interpolation spa\-ces for
the real method of interpolation using extrapolation theory. For this purpose
the usual tools (e.g., Boyd indices or the boundedness of Hardy type operators)
are not appropriate. Instead, our characterization hinges upon the boundedness
of some simple operators (e.g. $f\mapsto f(t^{2})/t$, or $f\mapsto f(t^{1/2}%
)$) acting on the underlying lattices that are used to control the $K$- and
$J$-functionals. Reiteration formulae, extending Holmstedt's classical
reiteration theorem to limiting spaces, are also proved and characterized in
this fashion. The resulting theory gives a unified roof to a large body of
literature that, using ad-hoc methods, had covered only special cases of the
results obtained here. Applications to Matsaev ideals, Grand Lebesgue spaces,
Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu-Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova limits, as well as a new vector
valued extrapolation theorems, are provided.

The bulk kinetic power of radio jets in active galactic nuclei,"  Based on the K\""onigl's inhomogeneous jet model, we estimate the jet
parameters, such as bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, viewing angle $\theta$ and
electron number density $n_{\rm e}$ from radio VLBI and X-ray data for a sample
of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) assuming that the X-rays are from the jet
rather than the intracluster gas. The bulk kinetic power of jets is then
calculated using the derived jet parameters. We find a strong correlation
between the total luminosity of broad emission lines and the bulk kinetic power
of the jets. This result supports the scenario that the accretion process are
tightly linked with the radio jets, though how the disk and jet are coupled is
not revealed by present correlation analysis. Moreover, we find a significant
correlation between the bulk kinetic power and radio extended luminosity. This
implies that the emission from the radio lobes are closely related with the
energy flux transported through jets from the central part of AGNs.
","The bulk kinetic power of radio jets in active galactic nuclei is directed inward to space, at or through the disk of the galactic center. In short, the mass of solar and plasma clouds lies in between the orbiter's orbit, where the force is of its own volumetric constant of around 8 × 10 6 G.

paper is devoted to investigating the basic structures of the colored HOMFLY-PT

the (reformulated) colored HOMFLY-PT invariants actually lie in the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[(q-q^{-1})^2,t^{\pm 1}]$. Secondly, we establish some symmetric
formulas for colored HOMFLY-PT invariants of links, which include the

congruent skein relations for (reformulated) colored HOMFLY-PT invariants which
are the generalizations of the skein relation for classical HOMFLY-PT

Search for high-energy neutrinos from dust obscured Blazars,"  The recent discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube neutrino
observatory opens up a new field in physics, the field of neutrino astronomy.
Using the IceCube neutrino detector we plan to search for high-energy neutrinos
emitted from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), since AGN are believed to be one of
the most promising sources of the most energetic cosmic rays and hence of
high-energy neutrinos. We discuss a specific type of AGN which we plan to
investigate in more detail with data obtained by the IceCube observatory. The
main properties of the AGN category in which we are interested are given by a
high-energy jet which is pointing in our line of sight defining a class of AGN,
called Blazars, and in particular the ones that are obscured by surrounding
dust. The jet-matter interaction is expected to give an increased high-energy
neutrino production. The properties of this specific type of AGN are expected
to give very distinct features in the electromagnetic spectrum, which are
discussed in detail.

Rip singularities are investigated. The energy densities for these fields are
computed at late times when the expansion is very rapid. For the massless
minimally coupled field it is shown that an attractor state exists in the sense
that, for a large class of states, the energy density of the field
asymptotically approaches the energy density it would have if it was in the
attractor state. Results of numerical computations of the energy density for
the massless minimally coupled field and for massive fields with minimal and
conformal coupling to the scalar curvature are presented. For the massive
fields the energy density is seen to always asymptotically approach that of the
corresponding massless field. The question of whether the energy densities of
quantized fields can be large enough for backreaction effects to remove the Big

"Emission properties of an oscillating point dipole from a gold Yagi-Uda
  nanoantenna array","  We investigate numerically the interaction of an oscillating point dipole
with a periodic array of optical Yagi-Uda nanoantennas in the weak coupling
limit. A very strong near-field enhancement of the dipole emission by the
resonant plasmon mode in the feed element is predicted in this structure. It is
shown that the enhancement strength depends strongly on the dipole position,
the direction of the dipole moment, and the oscillation frequency. The
radiative intensity of the point dipole from appropriate places next to one
feed element may exceed the radiative intensity of an equivalent dipole in
free-space by a factor of hundred. In spite of only one director used in each

The radiative efficiency (the ratio of the radiative to the full emission)

Continued Fractions and Linear Fractional Transformations,"  Rational approximations to a square root $\sqrt{k}$ can be produced by
iterating the transformation $f(x) = (dx+k)/(x+d)$ starting from $\infty$ for

often with continued fraction convergents if and only if $4d^2/(k-d^2)$ is an

of the concatenation of the continued fractions of certain explicitly definable
rational numbers, and it belongs to one of infinitely many families of

a crucial role to cover whole mass range of the wino dark matter. For example,
with $\delta (\log_{10}J) = 0.1$ for both the classical and the ultra-faint

Asymptotic decay for a one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation,"  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of finite energy solutions to the
one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear wave equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} =
|u|^{p-1} u$, where $p > 1$. Standard energy methods guarantee global
existence, but do not directly say much about the behaviour of $u(t)$ as $t \to
\infty$. Note that in contrast to higher-dimensional settings, solutions to the
linear equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} = 0$ do not exhibit decay, thus apparently
ruling out perturbative methods for understanding such solutions. Nevertheless,
we will show that solutions for the nonlinear equation behave differently from
the linear equation, and more specifically that we have the average $L^\infty$
decay $\lim_{T \to +\infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \|u(t)\|_{L^\infty_x(\R)}\ dt
= 0$, in sharp contrast to the linear case. An unusual ingredient in our
arguments is the classical Radamacher differentiation theorem that asserts that
Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable.

Non-minimal derivative coupling gravity in cosmology,"  We give a brief review of the non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) scalar
field theory in which there is non-minimal coupling between the scalar field
derivative term and the Einstein tensor. We assume that the expansion is of
power-law type or super-acceleration type for small redshift. The Lagrangian
includes the NMDC term, a free kinetic term, a cosmological constant term and a
barotropic matter term. For a value of the coupling constant that is compatible
with inflation, we use the combined WMAP9 (WMAP9+eCMB+BAO+ $H_0$) dataset, the
PLANCK+WP dataset, and the PLANCK $TT,TE,EE$+lowP+Lensing+ext datasets to find
the value of the cosmological constant in the model. Modeling the expansion
with power-law gives a negative cosmological constants while the phantom
power-law (super-acceleration) expansion gives positive cosmological constant
with large error bar. The value obtained is of the same order as in the
$\Lambda$CDM model, since at late times the NMDC effect is tiny due to small
curvature.
","Non-minimal derivative coupling gravity in cosmology can be expressed as

where M is the mass of the universe with a given mass and B = 0.5*M and the velocity of gravity at the M/B=M point. The gravity is assumed to be 1.0*H/m2, with its negative radius E = H1. This gives E and M. E is also given by

"Social Fingerprinting: detection of spambot groups through DNA-inspired
  behavioral modeling","  Spambot detection in online social networks is a long-lasting challenge
involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently
identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots has
emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go
undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show
that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of
their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling
the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart,
in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account
is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure
for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity
between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots.
Leveraging such characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting
technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in
both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We finally evaluate the
effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three
state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Among the peculiarities of our approach
is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study
online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of

"Towards a Simple, and Yet Accurate, Transistor Equivalent Circuit and
  Its Application to the Analysis and Design of Discrete and Integrated
  Electronic Circuits","  Transistors are the cornerstone of modern electronics. Yet, their relatively
complex characteristics, allied with often observed great parameter variation,
remain a challenge for discrete and integrated electronics. Much of transistor
research and applications have relied on transistor models, as well as
respective equivalent circuits, to be employed for circuit analysis and
simulations. Here, a simple and yet accurate transistor equivalent circuit is
derived, based on the Early effect, which involves only the voltage $V_a$ and a
companion parameter $s$. Equations are obtained for currents and voltages in a
common-emitter circuit, allowing the derivation of respective gain functions.
These functions are found to exhibit interesting mathematical structure, with
gain values varying almost linearly with the base current, allowing the gains
to be well characterized in terms of their average and variation values. These
results are applied to deriving a prototypic Early space summarizing the
characteristics of transistors, enriched with recently experimentally obtained
prototypes of NPN and PNP silicon BJTs and alloy germanium transistors. Though
a trade-off between gain and linearity is revealed, a band characterized by
small values of $V_a$ stands out when aiming at both high gain and low
distortion. The Early equivalent model was used also for studying the stability
of circuits under voltage supply oscillations, as well as parallel combinations
of transistors. In the former case, it was verified that more traditional
approaches assuming constant current gain can yield stability factors that
deviate substantially from those derived for the more accurate Early approach.
The equivalent circuit obtained for parallel combinations of transistors was
shown also to closely follow the Early formulation.

Optimal Dynamical Decoupling Sequence for Ohmic Spectrum,"  We investigate the optimal dynamical decoupling sequence for a qubit coupled
to an ohmic environment. By analytically computing the derivatives of the
decoherence function, the optimal pulse locations are found to satisfy a set of
nonlinear equations which can be easily solved. These equations incorporates
the environment information such as high-energy (UV) cutoff frequency \omega_c,
giving a complete description of the decoupling process. The solutions explain
previous experimental and theoretical results of locally optimized dynamical
decoupling (LODD) sequence in high-frequency dominated environment, which were
obtained by purely numerical computation and experimental feedback. As shown in
numerical comparison, these solutions outperform the Uhrig dynamical decoupling
(UDD) sequence by one or more orders of magnitude in the ohmic case.

A Penalty Method for Rank Minimization Problems in Symmetric Matrices,"  The problem of minimizing the rank of a symmetric positive semidefinite
matrix subject to constraints can be cast equivalently as a semidefinite
program with complementarity constraints (SDCMPCC). The formulation requires
two positive semidefinite matrices to be complementary. This is a continuous
and nonconvex reformulation of the rank minimization problem. We investigate
calmness of locally optimal solutions to the SDCMPCC formulation and hence show
that any locally optimal solution is a KKT point.
  We develop a penalty formulation of the problem. We present calmness results
for locally optimal solutions to the penalty formulation. We also develop a
proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) scheme for the penalty
formulation, and investigate the incorporation of a momentum term into the
algorithm. Computational results are presented.

Categorical Judgment with a Variable Decision Rule,"  A new Thurstonian rating scale model uses a variable decision rule (VDR) that
incorporates three previously formulated, distinct decision rules. The model
includes probabilities for choosing each rule, along with Gaussian
representation and criterion densities. Numerical optimisation techniques were
validated through demonstrating that the model fits simulated data tightly. For
simulations with 400 trials per stimulus (tps), useful information emerged
about the generating parameters. However, larger experiments (e.g. 4000 tps)
proved desirable for better recovery of generating parameters and to support
trustworthy choices between competing models by the Akaike Information
Criterion. In reanalyses of experiments by others, the VDR model explained most
of the data better than did classical signal detection theory models.
","Categorical Judgment with a Variable Decision Rule In this article, we are going to consider the impact of a variable decision rule like this on decision-making: in turn, when faced with an actual decision, a decision judge evaluates the possibility that the case may pass.

We show that any level 0 block of the category of smooth Z $\ell$-valued
representations of GL n (F) is equivalent to the unipotent block of an
appropriate product of GL n i (F i). To this end, we first show that the level
0 category of GL n (F) is equivalent to a category of "" modules "" over a

"Current-induced asymmetries of incompressible stripes in narrow quantum
  Hall systems","  We present recent experimental results confirming previously predicted strong
asymmetries of the current distribution in narrow Hall bars under the
conditions of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE). Using a previously
developed self-consistent screening and transport theory of the IQHE, we
investigate how these asymmetries, which are due to a non-linear feedback
effect of the imposed current on the electron distribution in the sample,
depend on relevant parameters, such as the strength of the imposed current, the
magnetic field, the temperature, and the collision broadening of the
Landau-quantized energy bands. We find that many aspects of the experimental

explicit consideration of mechanism, which enforce the breakdown of the IQHE.

treewidth of a certain graph representation (semi-primal graph) of the input

decompositions that decides whether a theory has a consistent stable extension
(Ext). Our algorithm can even be used to enumerate all generating defaults
(ExtEnum) that lead to stable extensions.
  We show that our algorithm decides Ext in linear time in the input theory and
triple exponential time in the treewidth (so-called fixed-parameter linear

  Further, our algorithm solves ExtEnum with a pre-computation step that is
linear in the input theory and triple exponential in the treewidth followed by
a linear delay to output solutions.

Efficient simulation of strong system-environment interactions,"  Multi-component quantum systems in strong interaction with their environment
are receiving increasing attention due to their importance in a variety of
contexts, ranging from solid state quantum information processing to the

difficult to simulate as the system-bath interactions cannot be treated
perturbatively and standard approaches are invalid or inefficient. Here we
combine the time dependent density matrix renormalization group methods with
techniques from the theory of orthogonal polynomials to provide an efficient

Sitter-like solution and a perturbative solution around the Schwarzschild-de

bound free parameters in these solutions, acoustic perturbations on fluid flows

"Predicting flow reversals in chaotic natural convection using data
  assimilation","  A simplified model of natural convection, similar to the Lorenz (1963)
system, is compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations in order to
test data assimilation methods and better understand the dynamics of
convection. The thermosyphon is represented by a long time flow simulation,
which serves as a reference ""truth"". Forecasts are then made using the
Lorenz-like model and synchronized to noisy and limited observations of the
truth using data assimilation. The resulting analysis is observed to infer
dynamics absent from the model when using short assimilation windows.
  Furthermore, chaotic flow reversal occurrence and residency times in each
rotational state are forecast using analysis data. Flow reversals have been
successfully forecast in the related Lorenz system, as part of a perfect model
experiment, but never in the presence of significant model error or unobserved

Magnetically-coupled piston pump for high-purity gas applications,"  Experiments based on noble elements such as gaseous or liquid argon or xenon
utilize the ionization and scintillation properties of the target materials to
detect radiation-induced recoils. A requirement for high light and charge
yields is to reduce electronegative impurities well below the ppb level. To
achieve this, the target material is continuously circulated in the gas phase
through a purifier and returned to the detector. Additionally, the low
backgrounds necessary dictate low-Rn-emanation rates from all components that
contact the gas.
  Since commercial pumps often introduce electronegative impurities from
lubricants on internal components or through small air leaks, and are not
designed to meet the radiopurity requirements, custom-built pumps are an
advantageous alternative. A new pump has been developed in Muenster in
cooperation with the nEXO group at Stanford University and the nEXO/XENON group
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based on a magnetically-coupled piston in a
hermetically sealed low-Rn-emanating vessel. This pump delivers high
performance for noble gases, reaching more than 210 standard liters per minute
(slpm) with argon and more than 170 slpm with xenon while maintaining a
compression of up to 1.9 bar, demonstrating its capability for noble gas
detectors and other applications requiring high standards of gas purity.

"Converged GW quasiparticle energies for transition metal oxide
  perovskites","  The ab initio calculation of quasiparticle (QP) energies is a technically and
computationally challenging problem. In condensed matter physics the most
widely used approach to determine QP energies is the GW approximation. Although
the GW method has been widely applied to many typical semiconductors and
insulators, its application to more complex compounds such as transition metal
oxide perovskites has been comparatively rare, and its proper use is not well
established from a technical point of view. In this work, we have applied the
single-shot G0W0 method to a representative set of transition metal oxide
perovskites including 3d (SrTiO3, LaScO3, SrMnO3, LaTiO3, LaVO3, LaCrO3,
LaMnO3, and LaFeO3), 4d (SrZrO3, SrTcO3, and Ca2RuO4) and 5d (SrHfO3, KTaO3 and
NaOsO3) compounds with different electronic configurations, magnetic orderings,
structural characteristics and bandgaps ranging from 0.1 to 6.1 eV. We discuss
the proper procedure to obtain well converged QP energies and accurate bandgaps
within single-shot G0W0 by comparing the conventional approach based on an
incremental variation of a specific set of parameters (number of bands, energy
cutoff for the plane-wave expansion and number of k-points and the basis-set
extrapolation scheme [Phys. Rev. B 90, 075125 (2014)]. In addition, we have
inspected the difference between the adoption of norm-conserving and ultrasoft
potentials in GW calculations. A minimal statistical analysis indicates that
the correlation of the GW data with the DFT gap is more robust than the
correlation with the experimental gaps; moreover we identify the static
dielectric constant as alternative useful parameter for the approximation of GW
gap in high-throughput automatic procedures. Finally, we compute the QP band
structure and spectra within the random phase approximation and compare the
results with available experimental data.

term, a quadratic model with a cubic regularizer for the twice differentiable
term, and perfect (proximal) model for the nonsmooth term. Our method in each
iteration minimizes the model over a random subset of blocks of the search

several existing methods, matching the best known bounds in all special cases.
We establish ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon)$, ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and ${\cal

"The Formation of IRIS Diagnostics. IX. The Formation of the C I 135.58
  Line in the Solar Atmosphere","  The C I 135.58 line is located in the wavelength range of NASA's Interface
Region Imagin Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission. We here study the

radiation-magnetohydrodynamic models. The C I/C II ionization balance is
strongly influenced by photoionization by Ly-alpha emission. The emission in
the C I 135.58 line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line
forming region is optically thick. The Doppler shift of the line correlates
strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is
typically located at 1.5 Mm height. With IRIS the C I 135.58 line is usually
observed together with the O I 135.56 line, and from the Doppler shift of both
lines, we obtain the velocity difference between the line forming regions of
the two lines. From the ratio of the C I/O I line core intensity, we can
determine the distance between the C I and the O I forming layers. Combined
with the velocity difference, the velocity gradient at mid-chromospheric

with the inverse of the electron density in the mid-chromosphere. We conclude
that the C I 135.58 line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere by

additional source of light, for example a flash. From a pair of input images
taken under different illumination, we define discriminative features that
implicitly contain facial three-dimensional in- formation. Furthermore, we show
that when multiple sources of light are considered, we are able to validate
which one has been activated. This makes possible the design of a highly secure
active-light authentication framework. Finally, further investigating the use
of 3D features without 3D reconstruction, we introduce an approximated
disparity-based implicit 3D feature obtained from an uncalibrated stereo-pair
of cameras. Valida- tion experiments show that the proposed methods produce
state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios with nearly no feature

A CEMP-no star in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pisces II,"  A probable carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star, Pisces II 10694, was
discovered recently in the ultra-faint (UFD) galaxy Pisces II. This galaxy is
supposed to be very old, suspected to include dark matter, and likely formed
the bulk of its stars before the reionisation of the Universe.
  New abundances have been obtained from observations of Pisces II 10694 at the
Kueyen ESO VLT telescope, using the high-efficiency spectrograph: X-Shooter.
  We found that Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star with [Fe/H]=-2.60 dex.
Careful measurements of the CH and C2 bands confirm the enhancement of the C
abundance ([C/Fe]=+1.23). This cool giant has very probably undergone extra
mixing and thus its original C abundance could be even higher. Nitrogen, O, Na,
and Mg are also strongly enhanced, but from Ca to Ni the ratios [X/Fe] are
similar to those observed in classical galactic very metal-poor stars. With its
low Ba abundance ([Ba/Fe] =-1.10 dex) Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star. No
variation in the radial velocity could be detected between the years 2015 and
2017. The pattern of the elements abundance has a shape similar to the pattern
found in galactic CEMP-no stars like CS 22949-037 ([Fe/H]=-4.0) or SDSS
J1349+1407 ([Fe/H]=-3.6). The existence of a CEMP-no star in the UFD galaxy
Pisc II suggests that this small galaxy likely hosted zero-metallicity stars.
This is consistent with theoretical predictions of cosmological models
supporting the idea that UFD galaxies are the living fossils of the first
star-forming systems.

The cluster's four disks, with the only cluster on our planet, have been predicted by the Kepler-17 system, the predecessor to the current supercomputer. In a region of very strong interaction between the stars, astronomers have observed such a faint star. A similar arrangement of disks have also been made using the supermassive black hole that is the Sun, however, one can only assume their size.

"Predicting the behavior of interacting humans by fusing data from
  multiple sources","  Multi-fidelity methods combine inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with
costly but highfidelity simulations to produce an accurate model of a system of
interest at minimal cost. They have proven useful in modeling physical systems
and have been applied to engineering problems such as wing-design optimization.
During human-in-the-loop experimentation, it has become increasingly common to
use online platforms, like Mechanical Turk, to run low-fidelity experiments to
gather human performance data in an efficient manner. One concern with these
experiments is that the results obtained from the online environment generalize
poorly to the actual domain of interest. To address this limitation, we extend
traditional multi-fidelity approaches to allow us to combine fewer data points
from high-fidelity human-in-the-loop experiments with plentiful but less
accurate data from low-fidelity experiments to produce accurate models of how
humans interact. We present both model-based and model-free methods, and

"Efficient differentially private learning improves drug sensitivity
  prediction","  Users of a personalised recommendation system face a dilemma: recommendations
can be improved by learning from data, but only if the other users are willing
to share their private information. Good personalised predictions are vitally
important in precision medicine, but genomic information on which the
predictions are based is also particularly sensitive, as it directly identifies
the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has
emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient
if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However,
differentially private learning with current methods does not improve
predictions with feasible data sizes and dimensionalities. Here we show that
useful predictors can be learned under powerful differential privacy
guarantees, and even from moderately-sized data sets, by demonstrating
significant improvements with a new robust private regression method in the
accuracy of private drug sensitivity prediction. The method combines two key
properties not present even in recent proposals, which can be generalised to
other predictors: we prove it is asymptotically consistently and efficiently
private, and demonstrate that it performs well on finite data. Good finite data
performance is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by
decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds,
therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. As already the
simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we
anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields, such
as mobile sensing and social media, in addition to the badly needed precision
medicine solutions.

A User Simulator for Task-Completion Dialogues,"  Despite widespread interests in reinforcement-learning for task-oriented
dialogue systems, several obstacles can frustrate research and development
progress. First, reinforcement learners typically require interaction with the
environment, so conventional dialogue corpora cannot be used directly. Second,
each task presents specific challenges, requiring separate corpus of
task-specific annotated data. Third, collecting and annotating human-machine or
human-human conversations for task-oriented dialogues requires extensive domain
knowledge. Because building an appropriate dataset can be both financially
costly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator
based upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement
learning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator.
Dialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting
point. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real
environment to interact with humans, and continue to be trained online. To ease
empirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new,
publicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the
movie-booking domain, leverages both rules and collected data. The simulator
supports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we
demonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own
agent in the proposed framework.

Conformal field theories with infinitely many conservation laws,"  Globally conformal invariant quantum field theories in a D-dimensional
space-time (D even) have rational correlation functions and admit an infinite
number of conserved (symmetric traceless) tensor currents. In a theory of a
scalar field of dimension D-2 they were demonstrated to be generated by bilocal
normal products of free massless scalar fields with an O(N), U(N), or Sp(2N)
(global) gauge symmetry [BNRT].
  Recently, conformal field theories ""with higher spin symmetry"" were
considered for D=3 in [MZ] where a similar result was obtained (exploiting
earlier study of CFT correlators). We suggest that the proper generalization of
the notion of a 2D chiral algebra to arbitrary (even or odd) dimension is
precisely a CFT with an infinite series of conserved currents. We shall recast
and complement (part of) the argument of Maldacena and Zhiboedov into the
framework of our earlier work. We extend to D=4 the auxiliary Weyl-spinor
formalism developed in [GPY] for D=3. The free field construction only follows
for D>3 under additional assumptions about the operator product algebra. In
particular, the problem of whether a rational CFT in 4D Minkowski space is
necessarily trivial remains open.
","Conformal field theories with infinitely many conservation laws, a great deal of time has been spent on this theory of conservation. The theory describes a system's conservation through time, so it's very obvious that it can't be deterministic.

But the basic idea of the theory is of course very simple. Suppose your system exists outside of its field of function. Now all of your conservation needs are in the field that has the conservation law, and it says, ""No conservation, including that of life, other than that created by the action of a physical body, must occur within the same period of space as the space within which it is created."" If life is not destroyed simultaneously then it takes only a single action to destroy it. Since the act of consuming a substance does not prevent a conservation of energy, the physical world requires a different conservation system for life.

"Second order Method for Solving 3D Elasticity Equations with Complex and
  Sharp Interfaces","  Elastic materials are ubiquitous in nature and indispensable components in
man-made devices and equipments. When a device or equipment involves composite
or multiple elastic materials, elasticity interface problems come into play.
The solution of three dimensional (3D) elasticity interface problems is
significantly more difficult than that of elliptic counterparts due to the
coupled vector components and cross derivatives in the governing elasticity
equation. This work introduces the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method
for solving 3D elasticity interface problems. The proposed MIB method utilizes
fictitious values on irregular grid points near the material interface to
replace function values in the discretization so that the elasticity equation
can be discretized using the standard finite difference schemes as if there
were no material interface. The interface jump conditions are rigorously
enforced on the intersecting points between the interface and the mesh lines.
Such an enforcement determines the fictitious values. A number of new technique
are developed to construct efficient MIB schemes for dealing with cross
derivative in coupled governing equations. The proposed method is extensively
validated over both weak and strong discontinuity of the solution, both
piecewise constant and position-dependent material parameters, both smooth and
nonsmooth interface geometries, and both small and large contrasts in the
Poisson's ratio and shear modulus across the interface. Numerical experiments
indicate that the present MIB method is of second order convergence in both
$L_\infty$ and $L_2$ error norms.

"Dust and star-formation properties of a complete sample of local
  galaxies drawn from the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue","  We combine Planck HFI data at 857, 545, 353 & 217GHz with data from WISE,
Spitzer, IRAS & Herschel to investigate the properties of a flux limited sample
of local star-forming galaxies. A 545GHz flux density limit was chosen so that
the sample is 80% complete at this frequency, giving a sample of 234 local
galaxies. We investigate the dust emission and star formation properties of the
sample via various models & calculate the local dust mass function. Although
1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very
well (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that
the SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and
10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter
wavelength data, & contributes ~1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is
negligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The
temp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star
formation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often
assumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from ~20 K dust is
powered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated
with star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a
free-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%. We find a median
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.0046; & that this ratio is anti-correlated with
galaxy mass. There is good correlation between dust mass & atomic gas mass
(median M_d/M_HI = 0.022), suggesting that galaxies that have more dust have
more interstellar medium in general. Our derived dust mass function implies a
mean dust mass density of the local Universe (for dust within galaxies), of
7.0+-1.4 x 10^5 M_solar/Mpc, significantly greater than that found in the most

In the 21st century, the light of distant local clusters represents a key aspect of the galaxy's formation. Small clusters that contain few or no stars can create more than 50 percent of galaxies in its local space. With the help of advanced gravitational theory, such clusters can be built so that they can form multiple galaxies. Such a complex array of gravitational gradients and spatial distributions could yield insights into the formation and evolution of entire galaxies and beyond. In the early 1990s, researchers at the University of Southern California (UCSB) and UTSB's Optical & Vision Center in La Jolla, California, developed a method that uses the local density of light (LDP) to obtain a measure of galaxy formation properties. The LDP measure is required to give the exact LPD resolution needed for a truly deep-type telescope. At UCSb, UMT and UTB, Ldp measure the LDC as a metric unit, and by doing simple math, they obtain an LDT of 20 standard deviations, about 1/4 the diameter of what would be required by measuring a standard deviation of 30 in this space camera. This provides new insights (by the way) into galaxy evolution and astrophysics – and is now the target of NASA's High Performance Image Search (HPE) project. [High Performance Images Search]

to hold essentially unchanged beyond the flat Euclidean configuration space.

"Hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations of turbulent flows -
  II. Cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters","  The development of turbulent gas flows in the intra-cluster medium and in the
core of a galaxy cluster is studied by means of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
cosmological simulations. A series of six runs was performed, employing
identical simulation parameters but different criteria for triggering the mesh
refinement. In particular, two different AMR strategies were followed, based on
the regional variability of control variables of the flow and on the
overdensity of subclumps, respectively. We show that both approaches, albeit
with different results, are useful to get an improved resolution of the
turbulent flow in the ICM. The vorticity is used as a diagnostic for
turbulence, showing that the turbulent flow is not highly volume-filling but
has a large area-covering factor, in agreement with previous theoretical
expectations. The measured turbulent velocity in the cluster core is larger
than 200 km/s, and the level of turbulent pressure contribution to the cluster
hydrostatic equilibrium is increased by using the improved AMR criteria.

Report: Error estimation of recovered solution in FE analysis,"  The recovery type error estimators introduced by Zienkiewicz and Zhu use a
recovered stress field evaluated from the Finite Element (FE) solution. Their
accuracy depends on the quality of the recovered field. In this sense, accurate
results are obtained using recovery procedures based on the Superconvergent
Patch recovery technique (SPR). These error estimators can be easily
implemented and provide accurate estimates. Another important feature is that
the recovered solution is of a better quality than the FE solution and can
therefore be used as an enhanced solution. We have developed an SPR-type
recovery technique that considers equilibrium and displacements constraints to
obtain a very accurate recovered displacements field from which a recovered
stress field can also be evaluated. We propose the use of these recovered
fields as the standard output of the FE code instead of the raw FE solution.
Techniques to quantify the error of the recovered solution are therefore
needed. In this report we present an error estimation technique that accurately
evaluates the error of the recovered solution both at global and local levels
in the FEM and XFEM frameworks. We have also developed an h-adaptive mesh
refinement strategy based on the error of the recovered solution. As the
converge rate of the error of the recovered solution is higher than that of the
FE one, the computational cost required to obtain a solution with a prescribed
accuracy is smaller than for traditional h-adaptive processes.

"Study of the flux effect on nuclear pressure vessel steel by measurement
  of magnetic properties","  Since Reactor Pressure Vessel steels are ferromagnetic, they provide a
convenient means to monitor changes in the mechanical properties of the
material upon irradiation with high energy particles, by measuring their
magnetic properties. Here, we discuss the correlation between these two
properties (i.e. mechanical and magnetic properties) and microstructure, by
studying the flux effect on the nuclear pressure vessel steel used in reactors
currently under construction in Argentina. Charpy-V notched specimens of this
steel were irradiated in the RA1 experimental reactor at 275{\deg}C with two
lead factors (LFs), 93 and 183. The magnetic properties were studied by means
of DC magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance. The results show that the
coercive field and magnetic anisotropy spatial distribution are sensitive to
the LF and can be explained by taking into account the evolution of the
microstructure with this parameter. The saturation magnetization shows a
dominant dependence on the accumulated damage. Consequently, the mentioned
techniques are suitable to estimate the degradation of the reactor vessel
steel.

"Improved Models for Cosmic Infrared Background Anisotropies: New
  Constraints on the IR Galaxy Population","  The power spectrum of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies is
sensitive to the connection between star formation and dark matter halos over
the entire cosmic star formation history. Here we develop a model that
associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos. The
model is based on a parameterized relation between the dust-processed infrared
luminosity and (sub)halo mass. By adjusting 3 free parameters, we attempt to
simultaneously fit the 4 frequency bands of the Planck measurement of the CIB
anisotropy power spectrum. To fit the data, we find that the star-formation
efficiency must peak on a halo mass scale of ~ 5x10^12 solar mass and the
infrared luminosity per unit mass must increase rapidly with redshift. By
comparing our predictions with a well-calibrated phenomenological model for
shot noise, and with a direct observation of source counts, we show that the
mean duty cycle of the underlying infrared sources must be near unity,
indicating that the CIB is dominated by long-lived quiescent star formation,
rather than intermittent short ""star bursts"". Despite the improved flexibility
of our model, the best simultaneous fit to all four Planck channels remains
relatively poor. We discuss possible further extensions to alleviate the
remaining tension with the data. Our model presents a theoretical framework for
a future joint analysis of both background anisotropy and source count
measurements.

Distributed delays stabilize neural feedback systems,"  We consider the effect of distributed delays in neural feedback systems. The
avian optic tectum is reciprocally connected with the nucleus isthmi.
Extracellular stimulation combined with intracellular recordings reveal a range
of signal delays from 4 to 9 ms between isthmotectal elements. This observation
together with prior mathematical analysis concerning the influence of a delay
distribution on system dynamics raises the question whether a broad delay
distribution can impact the dynamics of neural feedback loops. For a system of
reciprocally connected model neurons, we found that distributed delays enhance
system stability in the following sense. With increased distribution of delays,
the system converges faster to a fixed point and converges slower toward a
limit cycle. Further, the introduction of distributed delays leads to an
increased range of the average delay value for which the system's equilibrium
point is stable. The enhancement of stability with increasing delay
distribution is caused by the introduction of smaller delays rather than the
distribution per se.
","Distributed delays stabilize neural feedback systems, and they are particularly capable at minimizing or responding to changes in demand patterns. We found that activation of an early-phase neural network was not associated with a significant increase in rate of learning in older infants. However, only the network generated an increase of a factor of 50.10, which is consistent with the previous observation. A high degree of overlap between early and late learning could explain the neural signal delay. This might be further supported through the effects of specific factors of origin on neuronal activation following late-stage learning. It is also important to note that the timing of activation will depend a great deal on the condition or condition-specific effects the system experiences.

A third-order class-D amplifier with and without ripple compensation,"  We analyse the nonlinear behaviour of a third-order class-D amplifier, and
demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple
compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The
amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of
rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal
(pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the
steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability,
we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer
function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows
how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the
device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation
of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between
the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the
amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the
SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved
through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and
illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the
amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is
rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear
negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal
that slowly modulates the system parameters.

Modelling highway-traffic headway distributions using superstatistics,"  We study traffic clearance distributions (i.e., the instantaneous gap between
successive vehicles) and time headway distributions by applying Beck and

statistics to that of the random matrix theory. We derive an analytic
expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson
distribution and Wigner's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the nett
distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of
traffic flow. The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for
single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5.

Timeline Generation: Tracking individuals on Twitter,"  In this paper, we propose a unsupervised framework to reconstruct a person's

individual tweet collections, we find that what are suitable for inclusion in
the personal timeline should be tweets talking about personal (as opposed to

extract these types of topics, we introduce a non-parametric multi-level
Dirichlet Process model to recognize four types of tweets: personal
time-specific (PersonTS), personal time-general (PersonTG), public
time-specific (PublicTS) and public time-general (PublicTG) topics, which, in
turn, are used for further personal event extraction and timeline generation.

Low Energy Lorentz Violation in Polymer Quantization Revisited,"  In previous work, it had been shown that polymer quantized scalar field
theory predicts that even an inertial observer can experience spontaneous
excitations. This prediction was shown to hold at low energies. However, in
these papers it was assumed that the polymer scale is constant. But it is
possible to relax this condition and obtain a larger class of theories where
the polymer scale is a function of momentum. Does the prediction of low energy
Lorentz violation hold for all of these theories? In this paper we prove that
it does. We also obtain the modified rates of radiation for some of these
theories.

A search for Cyanopolyynes in L1157-B1,"  We present here a systematic search for cyanopolyynes in the shock region
L1157-B1 and its associated protostar L1157-mm in the framework of the Large
Program ""Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM"" (ASAI), dedicated to chemical surveys
of solar-type star forming regions with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observations of
the millimeter windows between 72 and 272 GHz permitted the detection of
HC$_3$N and its $^{13}$C isotopologues, and HC$_5$N (for the first time in a
protostellar shock region). In the shock, analysis of the line profiles shows
that the emission arises from the outflow cavities associated with L1157-B1 and
L1157-B2. Molecular abundances and excitation conditions were obtained from
analysis of the Spectral Line Energy Distributions under the assumption of
Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium or using a radiative transfer code in the
Large Velocity Gradient approximation. Towards L1157mm, the HC$_3$N emission
arises from the cold envelope ($T_{rot}=10$ K) and a higher-excitation region
($T_{rot}$= $31$ K) of smaller extent around the protostar. We did not find any
evidence of $^{13}$C or D fractionation enrichment towards L1157-B1. We obtain
a relative abundance ratio HC$_3$N/HC$_5$N of 3.3 in the shocked gas. We find
an increase by a factor of 30 of the HC$_3$N abundance between the envelope of
L1157-mm and the shock region itself. Altogether, these results are consistent
with a scenario in which the bulk of HC$_3$N was produced by means of gas phase
reactions in the passage of the shock. This scenario is supported by the
predictions of a parametric shock code coupled with the chemical model
UCL_CHEM.
","A search for Cyanopolyynes in L1157-B1B cells revealed a large level of B6, B3 and B4 in the cells after 10-days incubation. These B16 and M protein levels were higher in B11-treated cells, indicating that the B1 and T proteins in these tissues were released by bane release in vitro.

Because lysosomal B20 production by cyanotid microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, inactivation of the biosynthetic pathway leads to the formation of cDNA with DNA helices from co-homologs (11). It has been hypothesized that these modifications contribute to cyanotic bony DNA transcription. It is reported that bionic cytoplasmic microglia can be induced by chemical modification of lanyard-specific methylation by the biotic microenvironment and methylase activity resulting in altered bionscytosis under conditions to promote DNA bionicle formation. In this study, only cells that are not cyanotypic at the time of DNA modification were reported. Two further investigations showed that cyanospore-induced DNA alteration occurs in different types of plants under different conditions, but it is unclear whether the conditions will produce any change.",0.1634334984521565,0.13919413425056035,0.12184042642277504
Dynamic learning of pairwise and three-way entanglement,"  In previous work, we have developed a dynamic learning paradigm for
""programming"" a general quantum computer. A learning algorithm is used to find
a set of parameters for a coupled qubit system such that the system at an
initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement results in the
desired calculation value. This can be thought of as a quantum neural network
(QNN). Here, we apply our method to a system of three qubits, and demonstrate
training the quantum computer to estimate both pairwise and three-way
entanglement.

"Magnetic penetration depth of single crystal SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_y: a fully

in single crystals of SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ ($x\simeq y \simeq 0.2$) with $T_c

temperature dependence which suggests that the Fermi surface is fully gapped.
The magnitude of the minimum energy gap, $\Delta_1=1.1\pm 0.1 k_BT_c$ at T=0 K,
is significantly smaller than the BCS weak-coupling value suggesting that the
gap is either strongly anisotropic or varies significantly between the
different Fermi surface sheets. Our data fits well a two gap model with an

Super-resolution on the Sphere using Convex Optimization,"  This paper considers the problem of recovering an ensemble of Diracs on a
sphere from its low resolution measurements. The Diracs can be located at any
location on the sphere, not necessarily on a grid. We show that under a
separation condition, one can recover the ensemble with high precision by a
three-stage algorithm, which consists of solving a semi-definite program, root
finding and least-square fitting. The algorithm's computation time depends
solely on the number of measurements, and not on the required solution
accuracy. We also show that in the special case of non-negative ensembles, a
sparsity condition is sufficient for recovery. Furthermore, in the discrete
setting, we estimate the recovery error in the presence of noise as a function
of the noise level and the super-resolution factor.

"Combined modeling of sparse and dense noise for improvement of Relevance
  Vector Machine","  Using a Bayesian approach, we consider the problem of recovering sparse
signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models
outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods
simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of
no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating
the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the
RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined
noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix.
We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric
sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be
computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse
signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations,
we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several
applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price
prediction and image denoising.

As mentioned before, VML also provides for a simple transformation of the real world, using the new L2 data in a supervised fashion. To learn these R functions, you need to know enough about them. A very simple example is the training phase, in which there are 10 training samples, each with two parameters selected. We use that group from the standard test dataset to do the classification, a very easy task that can be done at any time using different data centers and different methods. In fact, the test data can also be sent to the supervised generator in our R package.

MCMC for Variationally Sparse Gaussian Processes,"  Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine
learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three
issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is
large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and
how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper
simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the
posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form.
The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a
non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters
simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs.
Code to replicate each experiment in this paper will be available shortly.

A Multiple-Valued Plateau Problem,"  The existence of Dirichlet minimizing multiple-valued functions for given
boundary data has been known since pioneering work of F. Almgren. Here we prove
a multiple-valued analogue of the classical Plateau problem of the existence of
area-minimizing mappings of the disk. Specifically, we find, for $K \in \mathbb
N,$ $k_1,...,k_K\in \mathbb N$ with sum $Q$ and any collection of $K$ disjoint
Lipschitz Neighborhood Retract Jordan curves, optimal multiple-valued boundary
data with these multiplicities which extends to a Dirichlet minimizing
$Q$-valued function with minimal Dirichlet energy among all possible monotone
parameterizations of the boundary curves. Under a condition analogous to the
Douglas condition for minimizers from planar domains, conformality of the
minimizer follows from topological methods and some complex analysis. Finally,
we analyze two particular cases: in contrast to single-valued Douglas
solutions, we first give a class of examples for which our multiple-valued
Plateau solution has branch points. Second, we give examples of a degenerate
behavior, illustrating the weakness of the multiple-valued maximum principle
and provide motivation for our analogous Douglas condition.
","A Multiple-Valued Plateau Problem

The problem arises when you use a nonlinear, linear path across a set of plateaus to form your data set. In a number of other problems, the solution to this problem can be simply to solve certain properties of the data for the set and then use the linearized paths to the points where the resulting data is known. (For a similar problem involving many other data structures, see the section ""Solving Multiple Plateaus for Random Fields."") But in a lot of cases, you want to make such a choice because you know that one property of all three of your plateau models might be a certain property. A lot can go wrong when things go very wrong for a given set if one of these properties is never set explicitly.

"Indices of Power in Optimal IDS Default Configuration: Theory and
  Examples","  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are becoming essential to protecting
modern information infrastructures. The effectiveness of an IDS is directly
related to the computational resources at its disposal. However, it is
difficult to guarantee especially with an increasing demand of network capacity
and rapid proliferation of attacks. On the other hand, modern intrusions often
come as sequences of attacks to reach some predefined goals. It is therefore
critical to identify the best default IDS configuration to attain the highest
possible overall protection within a given resource budget. This paper proposes
a game theory based solution to the problem of optimal signature-based IDS
configuration under resource constraints. We apply the concepts of indices of
power, namely, Shapley value and Banzhaf-Coleman index, from cooperative game
theory to quantify the influence or contribution of libraries in an IDS with
respect to given attack graphs. Such valuations take into consideration the
knowledge on common attack graphs and experienced system attacks and are used
to configure an IDS optimally at its default state by solving a knapsack
optimization problem.

On endomorphisms of torsion-free hyperbolic groups,"  Let $H$ be a torsion-free $\delta$-hyperbolic group with respect to a finite
generating set $S$. Let $a_1,..., a_n$ and $a_{1*},..., a_{n*}$ be elements of
$H$ such that $a_{i*}$ is conjugate to $a_i$ for each $i=1,..., n$. Then, there
is a uniform conjugator if and only if $W(a_{1*},..., a_{n*})$ is conjugate to
$W(a_1,..., a_n)$ for every word $W$ in $n$ variables and length up to a
computable constant depending only on $\delta$, $\sharp{S}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n
|a_i|$.
  As a corollary, we deduce that there exists a computable constant
$\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}(\delta, \sharp S)$ such that, for any endomorphism
$\phi$ of $H$, if $\phi(h)$ is conjugate to $h$ for every element $h\in H$ of
length up to $\mathcal {C}$, then $\phi$ is an inner automorphism.
  Another corollary is the following: if $H$ is a torsion-free conjugacy
separable hyperbolic group, then $\text{\rm Out}(H)$ is residually finite.
  When particularizing the main result to the case of free groups, we obtain a
solution for a mixed version of the classical Whitehead's algorithm.
","On endomorphisms of torsion-free hyperbolic groups and perpendicular to perpendicular groups are shown in.

"A cosmographic analysis of the transition to acceleration using SN-Ia
  and BAO","  We explore the distance-redshift relation using a cosmographic methodology,
and show how the cosmographic parameters can be used to determine the redshift
of transition from deceleration to acceleration. Such a transition at a low
redshift occupies only a small region of the available parameter space, and the
prior assumption of an early period of deceleration can significantly change
the posterior constraints. We use available type Ia Supernovae (SN-Ia) and
Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data sets to determine the cosmographic
deceleration $q_0$, jerk $j_0$, snap $s_0$ and lerk $l_0$ parameters. The
parameters are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model for a flat universe
within 2-sigma. We derive constraints on the redshift of transition from

"A hybrid on-chip opto-nanomechanical transducer for ultra-sensitive
  force measurements","  Nanomechanical oscillators have been employed as transducers to measure
force, mass and charge with high sensitivity. They are also used in opto- or
electromechanical experiments with the goal of quantum control and phenomena of
mechanical systems. Here, we report the realization and operation of a hybrid
monolithically integrated transducer system consisting of a high-$Q$
nanomechanical oscillator with modes in the MHz regime coupled to the
near-field of a high-$Q$ optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. The
transducer system enables a sensitive resolution of the nanomechanical beam's
thermal motion with a signal-to-noise of five orders of magnitude and has a
force sensitivity of $74\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. We
show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the sensitivity of continuous
incoherent force detection improves only with the fourth root of the averaging
time. Using dissipative feedback based on radiation pressure enabled control,
we explicitly demonstrate by detecting a weak incoherent force that this
constraint can be significantly relaxed. We achieve a more than 30-fold
reduction in averaging time with our hybrid transducer and are able to detect
an incoherent force having a force spectral density as small as
$15\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ within $35\,\rm{s}$ of averaging. This
corresponds to a signal which is 25 times smaller than the thermal noise and
would otherwise remain out of reach. The reported monolithic platform is an
enabling step towards hybrid nanomechanical transducers relying on the
light-mechanics interface.

"An experimental test of the viscous anisotropy hypothesis for partially
  molten rocks","  Chemical differentiation of rocky planets occurs by melt segregation away
from the region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex
and incompletely understood. In partially molten rocks undergoing shear
deformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field;
it has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an
anisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic
viscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle
of melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same
theoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due
to a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to
segregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation
experiments on partially molten rocks that test this prediction.
Microstructural analyses of the distribution of melt and solid reveal a radial
gradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder.
The extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain,
consistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and
experimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is
critical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution
of Earth.

Safe Control under Uncertainty,"  Controller synthesis for hybrid systems that satisfy temporal specifications
expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn
the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such
temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example,
many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through
machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we
propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an
expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce
probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe
controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption
that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables.
One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is
adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its
beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We
demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL
specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and
autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.

RoboChain: A Secure Data-Sharing Framework for Human-Robot Interaction,"  Robots have potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world
around us. One of their largest potentials is in the domain of mobile health
where they can be used to facilitate clinical interventions. However, to
accomplish this, robots need to have access to our private data in order to
learn from these data and improve their interaction capabilities. Furthermore,
to enhance this learning process, the knowledge sharing among multiple robot
units is the natural step forward. However, to date, there is no
well-established framework which allows for such data sharing while preserving
the privacy of the users (e.g., the hospital patients). To this end, we
introduce RoboChain - the first learning framework for secure, decentralized
and computationally efficient data and model sharing among multiple robot units
installed at multiple sites (e.g., hospitals). RoboChain builds upon and
combines the latest advances in open data access and blockchain technologies,
as well as machine learning. We illustrate this framework using the example of
a clinical intervention conducted in a private network of hospitals.
Specifically, we lay down the system architecture that allows multiple robot
units, conducting the interventions at different hospitals, to perform
efficient learning without compromising the data privacy.
","RoboChain: A Secure Data-Sharing Framework for Human-Robot Interaction

Abstract. In this paper, we provide a framework for a secure (networked) data-sharing framework designed to minimize the interaction of humans with each other. Because the database of data used by a human has a relatively small number of users and thus can be relatively large, secure data sharing allows for low-cost interactions between users. The model is able to use a set of known human-machine interactions to generate a highly scalable database to distribute distributed and unique information. We show how this is done with a simple implementation of a distributed data protocol, the RoboChain. Using this technique, a trusted human knows, and allows to process, both the social and the log. Users are required to complete the tasks that are described during the production process of the networked protocol. This method of sharing and manipulation of log data from the human is implemented in a variety of scenarios in different languages and technologies",0.29515207875032146,0.214592269735674,0.2055265210644837
"The influence of memory in deterministic walks in random media:
  analytical calculation within a mean field approximation","  Consider a random medium consisting of points randomly distributed so that
there is no correlation among the distances. This is the random link model,
which is the high dimensionality limit (mean field approximation) for the
euclidean random point structure. In the random link model, at discrete time
steps, the walker moves to the nearest site, which has not been visited in the
last $\mu$ steps (memory), producing a deterministic partially self avoiding
walk (the tourist walk). We have obtained analitically the distribution of the
number $n$ of points explored by a walker with memory $\mu = 2$, as well as the
transient and period joint distribution. This result enables to explain the
abrupt change in the exploratory behavior between the cases $\mu = 1$
(memoryless, driven by extremal statistics) and $\mu = 2$ (with memory, driven
by combinatorial statistics). In the $\mu = 1$ case, the mean newly visited
points in the thermodynamic limit $(N \gg 1)$ is just $<n > = e = 2.72 ...$
while in the $\mu = 2$ case, the mean number $<n>$ of visited points is
proportional to $N^{1/2}$. Also, this result allows us to stabilish an
equivalence between the random link model with $\mu=2$ and random map
(uncorrelated back and forth distances) with $\mu=0$ and the drastic change
between the cases where the transient time is null compared to non-null
transient times.

The model consisted of a matrix of images that were used to evaluate whether stimuli were positive or negative. The results of this model were compared with control experiments on subjects that had a control group of participants and were treated with a two-way analysis of variance (B-sample t test).

About disposition of energy levels,"  The unique properties of central potential of the form $-\beta
e^{-r}r^{\gamma}$ were studied using the recently developed critical parameter
technique. The particular cases of $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=-1$ yield,
respectively, the exponential and Yukawa potentials widely used in the atomic,
molecular and nuclear physics. We found different behavior of the energy levels
of this potential for three different ranges of the value of $\gamma$. For
$\gamma\geq0$ it was found that the energy of bound states with the same
principal quantum number $N$ decreases with increasing angular momentum $\ell$.
The Gaussian and Woods-Saxon potentials also show this behavior. On the
contrary, for $-2\leq\gamma\leq-1$ increasing $\ell$ gives a higher energy,
resembling the Hulthen potential. However, a potential with $-1<\gamma<0$
possesses mixed properties, which give rise to several interesting results. For
one, the order of energy levels with different quantum numbers is not preserved
when varying the parameter $\beta$. This leads to a quantum degeneracy of the
states, and in fact, for a given value of $\gamma$ we can find the values
$\beta_{thr}$ for which two energy levels with different quantum numbers
coincide. Another interesting phenomena is the possibility, for some values of
$\gamma$ in this range, for two new energy levels with different quantum
numbers to appear simultaneously when $\beta$ reaches their common critical
value.

"Hidden multipolar orders of dipole-octupole doublets on a triangular
  lattice","  Motivated by the recent development in strong spin-orbit-coupled materials,
we consider the dipole-octupole doublets on the triangular lattice. We propose
the most general interaction between these unusual local moments. Due to the
spin-orbit entanglement and the special form of its wavefunction, the
dipole-octupole doublet has a rather peculiar property under the lattice
symmetry operation. As a result, the interaction is highly anisotropic in the
pseudospin space, but remarkably, is uniform spatially. We analyze the ground
state properties of this generic model and emphasize the hidden multipolar
orders that emerge from the dipolar and octupolar interactions. We clarify the
quantum mutual modulations between the dipolar and octupolar orders. We predict

"Gaussian covariance matrices for anisotropic galaxy clustering
  measurements","  Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific
source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance
estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models
of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of
accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance
is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on
simulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology
dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this
work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of
anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.
Considering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and
projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering
wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic
clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case
of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of
this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space
covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy
catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body
simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good
agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic
catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.

time and space associated to moving bodies. This extension derives from the
analysis of the wave-fronts of the light emitted by a moving source in inertial
motion in the empty space, as viewed from the stationary reference. Indeed,
time and space can be represented by the same vector quantities, which appear
asymmetrical in forward and back direction along the path of the moving body.
Consequently, the whole size of the moving bodies dilates along the direction
of their motion, as their path. Thought experiments and real facts demonstrate
this issue.

"Integration of Differential Gene-combination Search and Gene Set
  Enrichment Analysis: A General Approach","  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and its variations aim to discover
collections of genes that show moderate but coordinated differences in
expression. However, such techniques may be ineffective if many individual
genes in a phenotype-related gene set have weak discriminative power. A
potential solution is to search for combinations of genes that are highly
differentiating even when individual genes are not. Although such techniques
have been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to any
significant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinations
and the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided by
gene groups of different sizes.
  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, we
propose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure that
reduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes by
summarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene in
a single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores from
combinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures by
mapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data sets
demonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search can
enhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that include
genes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminative
power. Also, gene sets discovered by the integrative framework share several
common biological processes and improve the consistency of the results among
three lung cancer data sets.

 (2014) Abstract: In this paper we propose a general way to characterize genetic variation and to improve the interpretation of genome changes. This approach can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative approaches. First, we identify the contribution of gene pairs to genetic complexity; second, to identify whether the observed variation influences the results of current genetic algorithms. We provide quantitative solutions in two ways: (i) using the nonparametric (F, M) method to analyze the resulting (nonproportional) contribution (R) of genetic information; and (ii) estimating the impact of some (r) genetic changes on a genetic function by considering all known genome alterations and thus increasing the number of estimates. The quantitative methods can be applied to the many different types of human population samples; the information is gathered, compared with population projections and the available datasets. As the model increases in complexity, the prediction and statistical significance of changes in the data of particular populations are lowered when their numbers are known in advance. However, under this hypothesis the predictions become increasingly low-dimensional when they have a more high-precision estimate.

is compatible with extrapolating the X-ray power-law down to the ultra-violet
region. This constitutes strong support for a common origin of the jet's far-UV
and X-ray emission. It implies that even a substantial fraction of the *visible
light* in the X-ray brightest parts of the jet arises from the same spectral
component as the X-rays, as had been suggested earlier based on Spitzer Space

Using highly excited baryons to catch the quark mass,"  Chiral symmetry in QCD can be simultaneously in Wigner and Goldstone modes,
depending on the part of the spectrum examined. The transition regime between
both, exploiting for example the onset of parity doubling in the high baryon
spectrum, can be used to probe the running quark mass in the mid-IR power-law
regime. In passing we also argue that three-quark states naturally group into
same-flavor quartets, split into two parity doublets, all splittings decreasing
high in the spectrum. We propose that a measurement of masses of high-partial
wave Delta* resonances should be sufficient to unambiguously establish the
approximate degeneracy and see the quark mass running. We test these concepts
with the first computation of the spectrum of high-J excited baryons in a
chiral-invariant quark model.

moderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an

via a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<
4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which
indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =
-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}

0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times
10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium
temperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm
2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to
other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced

planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal
the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a
projected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity
measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to
have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow
rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to
have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the

The star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the COSMOS field,"  We explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for
3.6um-selected galaxies of different M_* in the COSMOS field. The average SFR
for sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4GHz radio continuum
emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (SF)
that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame
optical SED. At 0.2<z<3 both populations show a strong and M_*-independent
decrease in their SSFR towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,
where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for SF sources. The decrease appears to
have started at z>2, at least above 4x10^10M_Sun where our conclusions are most
robust. We find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR (M_*)^beta,
between SSFR and M_* at all z. It tends to flatten below ~10^10M_Sun if
quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_SFG
-0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher M_* objects always have lower
SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an
upper SSFR-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. It is suggested by a
flattening of the SSFR-M_* relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive
(>10^10M_Sun) galaxies only at the highest z. Below z=1.5 there thus is no
direct evidence that galaxies of higher M_* experience a more rapid waning of
their SSFR than lower M_* SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any
strong 'downsizing'. We combine our results with recent measurements of the
galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of
a SF galaxy (M_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)M_Sun). In this sense, too, there is no
'downsizing'. Our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density
determination with a single technique to z=3. Recent Herschel results are
consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.
","The star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the COSMOS field is complex because they are so large, and hence it is necessary to determine their ages through careful calculations. Many scientists already know from the discovery of the Big Magellanic Cloud that they hold an age of about 3.5 billion million years old. They have been following a period from about 10,000 to 50,00 years ago where they observed a massive and massive-sized galaxy. A recent study using the same astronomical technique and the Higgs boson, using a combination of a massless particle approach and classical dynamical theory, showed that the estimated ages of these supernovae are already well over the 100,600-year period before the M. cephalota ""halo"" began. This is significant because mass decreases with age, which in turn means that supernova explosions may have occurred much earlier for their age than is suggested to be possible.

"Missing baryons traced by the galaxy luminosity density in the
  large-scale WHIM filaments","  We propose a new approach to the missing baryons problem. Building on the
common assumption that the missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot
Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), we further assumed here that the galaxy luminosity
density can be used as a tracer of the WHIM. The latter assumption is supported
by our finding of a significant correlation between the WHIM density and the
galaxy luminosity density in the hydrodynamical simulations of Cui et al.
(2012). We further found that the fraction of the gas mass in the WHIM phase is
substantially (by a factor of $\sim$1.6) higher within the large scale galactic
filaments, i.e. $\sim$70\%, compared to the average in the full simulation
volume of $\sim$0.1\,Gpc$^3$. The relation between the WHIM overdensity and the
galaxy luminosity overdensity within the galactic filaments is consistent with
linear: $\delta_{\rm whim}\,=\,0.7\,\pm\,0.1\,\times\,\delta_\mathrm{LD}^{0.9
\pm 0.2}$. We applied our procedure to the line of sight to the blazar
H2356-309 and found evidence for the WHIM in correspondence of the Sculptor
Wall (z $\sim$0.03 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$) and Pisces-Cetus
superclusters (z $\sim$0.06 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.7^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$), in
agreement with the redshifts and column densities of the X-ray absorbers
identified and studied by Fang et al. (2010) and Zappacosta et al. (2010). This
agreement indicates that the galaxy luminosity density and galactic filaments
are reliable signposts for the WHIM and that our method is robust in estimating
the WHIM density. The signal that we detected cannot originate from the halos
of the nearby galaxies since they cannot account for the large WHIM column
densities that our method and X-ray analysis consistently find in the Sculptor
Wall and Pisces-Cetus superclusters.
","Missing baryons traced by the galaxy luminosity density in the
  large-scale WHIM filaments in this study and others, are much slower than the HSM in terms of the large number and duration of HspC at the center.

This is the first detailed picture of a planetary background in visible light over a single galaxy to date, with an abundance of light from such distant galaxies in its background (for example, one of these is seen in a very late epoch in our star formation history). Many smaller planetary masses in general are brighter than they appear in planetary light, but they do not appear on the surface. This is because it is nearly impossible to observe the dark regions of our planet through visible medium. We can see only faint dark patches on either side of their star-forming disk, and this fact in turn is of special significance in determining the mass composition of distant exoplanets and planets. With the discovery of this data, the authors estimate that the density-related masses of an orbiting dwarf planet in interstellar medium could be as many as 5,000 times the expected density of star life in their atmosphere (in many cases, that would be twice Earth's atmospheric density). In comparison, their estimate for the brightness of interstellar planets suggests an expected mass density similar to that of Earth.

P-adic Asai L-functions of Bianchi modular forms,"  The Asai (or twisted tensor) $L$-function of a Bianchi modular form $\Psi$ is
the $L$-function attached to the tensor induction to $\mathbb{Q}$ of its
associated Galois representation. In this paper, when $\Psi$ is ordinary at $p$
we construct a $p$-adic analogue of this $L$-function: that is, a $p$-adic
measure on $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ that interpolates the critical values of the
Asai $L$-function twisted by Dirichlet characters of $p$-power conductor. The
construction uses techniques analogous to those used by Lei, Zerbes and the

representation of a quadratic Hilbert modular form.

Towards applied theories based on computability logic,"  Computability logic (CL) (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) is a
recently launched program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of
computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that logic has more
traditionally been. Formulas in it represent computational problems, ""truth""
means existence of an algorithmic solution, and proofs encode such solutions.
Within the line of research devoted to finding axiomatizations for ever more
expressive fragments of CL, the present paper introduces a new deductive system
CL12 and proves its soundness and completeness with respect to the semantics of
CL. Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering
considerable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a
reasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical
logic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such
theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano
arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of
the present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author
wishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of
interesting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual
metatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems.
","Towards applied theories based on computability logic, the first approach was to take our current concepts of data and its representation as a simple mathematical notation. Here also comes the fundamental idea of the logarithm:


log(a-b) = a + b

The third method would be to use the notation of log(x) to prove what an x can have. This would entail that we can prove by means of such logic that the original data (either some arbitrary data object or some data class with a default of x is true) were a log x (or any arbitrary type of it). The last method, known as the real log, would apply the logical logic of a given field to a field. We would then apply that logic to just the data, e.g. for a variable of type E where there is no attribute (x). With this logic we would prove, for instance, that our",0.24120203310441396,0.13043477768279793,0.1869380028395646

achieved if in addition to the elastic channel we include the $\pi\Delta$ and

"Verification of Inconsistency-Aware Knowledge and Action Bases (Extended

introduced as a mechanism that provides a semantically rich representation of
the information on the domain of interest in terms of a DL KB and a set of
actions to change such information over time, possibly introducing new objects.
In this setting, decidability of verification of sophisticated temporal
properties over KABs, expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus, has
been shown. However, the established framework treats inconsistency in a
simplistic way, by rejecting inconsistent states produced through action
execution. We address this problem by showing how inconsistency handling based
on the notion of repairs can be integrated into KABs, resorting to
inconsistency-tolerant semantics. In this setting, we establish decidability
and complexity of verification.

"A Novel Solution to the Dynamic Routing and Wavelength Assignment
  Problem in Transparent Optical Networks","  We present an evolutionary programming algorithm for solving the dynamic
routing and wavelength assignment (DRWA) problem in optical wavelength-division

requests due to the physical impairments. The problem formulation includes
suitable constraints that enable the algorithm to balance the load among the
individuals and thus results in a lower blocking probability and lower mean

A conjugate gradient algorithm for the astrometric core solution of Gaia,"  The ESA space astrometry mission Gaia, planned to be launched in 2013, has
been designed to make angular measurements on a global scale with
micro-arcsecond accuracy. A key component of the data processing for Gaia is
the astrometric core solution, which must implement an efficient and accurate
numerical algorithm to solve the resulting, extremely large least-squares
problem. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is a framework that
allows to implement a range of different iterative solution schemes suitable
for a scanning astrometric satellite. In order to find a computationally
efficient and numerically accurate iteration scheme for the astrometric
solution, compatible with the AGIS framework, we study an adaptation of the
classical conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and compare it to the so-called
simple iteration (SI) scheme that was previously known to converge for this
problem, although very slowly. The different schemes are implemented within a
software test bed for AGIS known as AGISLab, which allows to define, simulate
and study scaled astrometric core solutions. After successful testing in
AGISLab, the CG scheme has been implemented also in AGIS. The two algorithms CG
and SI eventually converge to identical solutions, to within the numerical
noise (of the order of 0.00001 micro-arcsec). These solutions are independent
of the starting values (initial star catalogue), and we conclude that they are
equivalent to a rigorous least-squares estimation of the astrometric
parameters. The CG scheme converges up to a factor four faster than SI in the
tested cases, and in particular spatially correlated truncation errors are much
more efficiently damped out with the CG scheme.
","A conjugate gradient algorithm for the astrometric core solution of Gaia, the Earth is a magnet to magnet interface, whose gravitational wave interactions are in sync with that of the magnetic field generated by the core. The orbital motion of some cores with Gaia's gravity may be due to tidal forces along its edges, which could in turn, increase its gravity. For example, a tidal pulse at a core is equal to the initial phase of its ionize motion, and hence, it will spin at the surface of Earth. Due to both the orbital motions and the gravitational impact, this initial spin is increased by a large power by pushing some other core towards the planet. As a result of this momentum, Gaia is the dominant magnet in the earth's magnetosphere. This magnetic flow is carried by Gaia to its magnetosts. These secondary elements can be integrated into the solar energy of each fusion device and can thus allow them to generate an excess of magnetic wave contact.

Cross-Domain Sparse Coding,"  Sparse coding has shown its power as an effective data representation method.
However, up to now, all the sparse coding approaches are limited within the
single domain learning problem. In this paper, we extend the sparse coding to
cross domain learning problem, which tries to learn from a source domain to a
target domain with significant different distribution. We impose the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion to reduce the cross-domain distribution
difference of sparse codes, and also regularize the sparse codes by the class
labels of the samples from both domains to increase the discriminative ability.
The encouraging experiment results of the proposed cross-domain sparse coding
algorithm on two challenging tasks --- image classification of photograph and
oil painting domains, and multiple user spam detection --- show the advantage
of the proposed method over other cross-domain data representation methods.

"Efficiency of energy funneling in the photosystem II supercomplex of
  higher plants","  The investigation of energy transfer properties in photosynthetic
multi-protein networks gives insight into their underlying design
principles.Here, we discuss excitonic energy transfer mechanisms of the
photosystem II (PS-II) C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ supercomplex, which is the largest
isolated functional unit of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher
plants.Despite the lack of a decisive energy gradient in C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$, we
show that the energy transfer is directed by relaxation to low energy states.
C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ is not organized to form pathways with strict energetic
downhill transfer, which has direct consequences on the transfer efficiency,
transfer pathways and transfer limiting steps. The exciton dynamics is
sensitive to small structural changes, which, for instance, are induced by the
reorganization of vibrational coordinates. In order to incorporate the
reorganization process in our numerical simulations, we go beyond rate
equations and use the hierarchically coupled equation of motion approach
(HEOM). While transfer from the peripherical antenna to the proteins in
proximity to the reaction center occurs on a faster time scale, the final step
of the energy transfer to the RC core is rather slow, and thus the limiting
step in the transfer chain. Our findings suggest that the structure of the
PS-II supercomplex guarantees photoprotection rather than optimized efficiency.

fluid (2DEF) in the quantum regime (at T=0) are calculated using a
classical-map-hyper-netted-chain (CHNC) scheme and compared with currently
available Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations in the coupling range r_s=1 to
50. We iteratively extract the bridge function of the ""equivalent"" classical

changes significantly for r_s>6, suggesting the onset of strongly correlated

be used to replace the hard-sphere B(r) previously used in these calculations.

synchronized depth with color, called RGB-D image. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised method for indoor RGB-D image segmentation and analysis. We
consider a statistical image generation model based on the color and geometry
of the scene. Our method consists of a joint color-spatial-directional
clustering method followed by a statistical planar region merging method. We
evaluate our method on the NYU depth database and compare it with existing
unsupervised RGB-D segmentation methods. Results show that, it is comparable
with the state of the art methods and it needs less computation time. Moreover,
it opens interesting perspectives to fuse color and geometry in an unsupervised

Splitting of quantum information using N-qubit linear cluster states,"  We provide a number of schemes for the splitting up of quantum information

such that the original information can be reconstructed only if all the parties

Contest based on a directed polymer in a random medium,"  We introduce a simple one-parameter game derived from a model describing the
properties of a directed polymer in a random medium. At his turn, each of the
two players picks a move among two alternatives in order to maximize his final
score, and minimize opponent's return. For a game of length $n$, we find that
the probability distribution of the final score $S_n$ develops a traveling wave
form, ${\rm Prob}(S_n=m)=f(m-v n)$, with the wave profile $f(z)$ unusually
decaying as a double exponential for large positive and negative $z$. In
addition, as the only parameter in the game is varied, we find a transition
where one player is able to get his maximum theoretical score. By extending
this model, we suggest that the front velocity $v$ is selected by the nonlinear
marginal stability mechanism arising in some traveling wave problems for which
the profile decays exponentially, and for which standard traveling wave theory
applies.

denoted by I_{f}(P), is k if there are k distinct tangents to the graph of f
which pass through P. In section 2 we prove results about the illumination
index of f with f"" (x)\geq 0 on \Re. In particular, suppose that y=L_1(x) and
y=L_2(x) are distinct oblique asymptotes of f and let P=(s,t)\in G_{f}^{C}. If
max(L_1(s),L_2(s))<t<f(s), then I_{f}(P)=2. If L_1(s)\not= L_2(s) and

  Finally, if t_\leqmin(L_1(s),L_2(s)), then I_{f}(P)=0. We also show that any

must have illumination index equal to 2. In section 3 we also prove results
about the illumination index of polynomials.

More on Gribov copies and propagators in Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory,"  Fixing a gauge in the non-perturbative domain of Yang-Mills theory is a
non-trivial problem due to the presence of Gribov copies. In particular, there
are different gauges in the non-perturbative regime which all correspond to the
same definition of a gauge in the perturbative domain. Gauge-dependent
correlation functions may differ in these gauges. Two such gauges are the
minimal and absolute Landau gauge, both corresponding to the perturbative
Landau gauge. These, and their numerical implementation, are described and
presented in detail. Other choices will also be discussed.
  This investigation is performed, using numerical lattice gauge theory
calculations, by comparing the propagators of gluons and ghosts for the minimal
Landau gauge and the absolute Landau gauge in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is
found that the propagators are different in the far infrared and even at energy
scales of the order of half a GeV. In particular, also the finite-volume
effects are modified. This is observed in two and three dimensions. Some
remarks on the four-dimensional case are provided as well.

Worldsheet Description of Exotic Five-brane with Two Gauged Isometries,"  We study the string worldsheet description of the background geometry of the
exotic $5^2_2$-brane where two isometries are gauged. This is an extension of
the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) for the exotic $5^2_2$-brane with a single
gauged isometry. The new GLSM with two gauged isometries has only ${\mathcal
N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry rather than ${\mathcal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetry of the
original GLSM. This is caused by a conflict between two different $SU(2)_R$
associated with the two gauge symmetries. However, if we take a certain limit,
we can find the genuine string sigma model of the background geometry of the
exotic $5^2_2$-brane with ${\mathcal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetry. We also
investigate the worldsheet instanton corrections to the background geometry of
the exotic $5^2_2$-brane. The worldsheet instanton corrections to the string
sigma model can be traced in terms of the two gauge fields in the new GLSM.
This new GLSM gives rise to a different feature of the quantum corrections from

A structural analysis of the A5/1 state transition graph,"  We describe efficient algorithms to analyze the cycle structure of the graph
induced by the state transition function of the A5/1 stream cipher used in GSM
mobile phones and report on the results of the implementation. The analysis is
performed in five steps utilizing HPC clusters, GPGPU and external memory
computation. A great reduction of this huge state transition graph of 2^64
nodes is achieved by focusing on special nodes in the first step and removing
leaf nodes that can be detected with limited effort in the second step. This
step does not break the overall structure of the graph and keeps at least one
node on every cycle. In the third step the nodes of the reduced graph are
connected by weighted edges. Since the number of nodes is still huge an
efficient bitslice approach is presented that is implemented with NVIDIA's CUDA
framework and executed on several GPUs concurrently. An external memory
algorithm based on the STXXL library and its parallel pipelining feature
further reduces the graph in the fourth step. The result is a graph containing
only cycles that can be further analyzed in internal memory to count the number
and size of the cycles. This full analysis which previously would take months
can now be completed within a few days and allows to present structural results
for the full graph for the first time. The structure of the A5/1 graph deviates

Cluster tilting for higher Auslander algebras,"  The concept of cluster tilting gives a higher analogue of classical Auslander
correspondence between representation-finite algebras and Auslander algebras.
The $n$-Auslander-Reiten translation functor $\tau_n$ plays an important role
in the study of $n$-cluster tilting subcategories. We study the category
$\MM_n$ of preinjective-like modules obtained by applying $\tau_n$ to injective
modules repeatedly. We call a finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$
\emph{$n$-complete} if $\MM_n=\add M$ for an $n$-cluster tilting object $M$.
Our main result asserts that the endomorphism algebra $\End_\Lambda(M)$ is
$(n+1)$-complete. This gives an inductive construction of $n$-complete
algebras. For example, any representation-finite hereditary algebra
$\Lambda^{(1)}$ is 1-complete. Hence the Auslander algebra $\Lambda^{(2)}$ of
$\Lambda^{(1)}$ is 2-complete. Moreover, for any $n\ge1$, we have an
$n$-complete algebra $\Lambda^{(n)}$ which has an $n$-cluster tilting object
$M^{(n)}$ such that $\Lambda^{(n+1)}=\End_{\Lambda^{(n)}}(M^{(n)})$. We give
the presentation of $\Lambda^{(n)}$ by a quiver with relations. We apply our
results to construct $n$-cluster tilting subcategories of derived categories of
$n$-complete algebras.

"The astronomical garden of Venus and Mars-NG915: the pivotal role of
  Astronomy in dating and deciphering Botticelli's masterpiece","  This essay demonstrates the key role of Astronomy in Botticelli's ""Venus and
Mars-NG915"" painting, to date only very partially understood. Worthwhile
coincidences among the principles of the Ficinian philosophy, the historical
characters involved and the compositional elements of the painting, show how
the astronomical knowledge of that time strongly influenced this masterpiece.
First, Astronomy provides its precise dating since the artist used the
astronomical ephemerides of his time, albeit preserving a mythological meaning,
and a clue for Botticelli's signature. Second, it allows the correlation among
Botticelli's creative intention, the historical facts and the astronomical
phenomena such as the heliacal rising of the planet Venus in conjunction with
the Aquarius constellation dating back to the earliest representations of Venus
in Mesopotamian culture. This work not only bears a significant value for the
history of science and art, but, in the current era of three-dimensional
mapping of billion stars about to be delivered by Gaia, states the role of
astronomical heritage in Western culture. Finally, following the same method, a
precise astronomical dating for the famous Primavera painting is suggested.

"Three-point phase correlations: A new measure of non-linear large-scale
  structure","  We derive an analytical expression for a novel large-scale structure
observable: the line correlation function. The line correlation function, which
is constructed from the three-point correlation function of the phase of the
density field, is a robust statistical measure allowing the extraction of
information in the non-linear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in
perturbation theory, the line correlation is sensitive to the coupling kernel
F_2, which governs the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field.
We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations
and find a 1-sigma agreement for separations r<30 Mpc/h. Fitting formulae for
the power spectrum and the non-linear coupling kernel at small scales allow us
to extend our prediction into the strongly non-linear regime where we find a
1-sigma agreement with the simulations for r<2 Mpc/h. We discuss the advantages
of the line correlation relative to standard statistical measures like the
bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the line correlation is independent of the bias,
in the regime where the bias is local and linear. Furthermore, the variance of
the line correlation is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of
the density field. This suggests that the line correlation can probe more
precisely the non-linear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the
power spectrum variance.

Geographic constraints on social network groups,"  Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our
social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been
impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this
restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of
individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also
classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection
algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of
varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and
geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are
geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size
exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological
positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities.
These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and
spatial constraints.
","Geographic constraints on social network groups may complicate the ability of data to identify social networks that are socially engaged – a concept that has been explored in a variety of recent data systems.

The most common social-network analysis technique for identifying social groups is called meta-analysis (MOSS), which relies on meta and sub-meta search criteria for the meta results. While meta does require all users to complete a certain threshold to be included in these statistics, these threshold levels are often more variable than those of search within the social community.

"Evolution of the dust emission of massive galaxies up to z=4 and
  constraints on their dominant mode of star formation","  We aim to measure the average dust and molecular gas content of massive
star-forming galaxies ($\rm > 3 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$) up to z=4 in the
COSMOS field to determine if the intense star formation observed at high
redshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.
Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions
as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel,
LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects
and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We
found that the mean intensity of the radiation field $< U >$ heating the dust
(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift
up to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with
simple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity with
redshift. No evolution of $< U >$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.
We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as
$\rm M_{\rm mol}/(M_{\rm mol}+M_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,
steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches
$\sim$60%. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus
of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt
diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the
bulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

to such a large degree that the observed expansion of this galaxy is over the time line
. It should be noted in connection with this that several authors have proposed, especially for the new observational observations which are included in this publication, that an increase in galaxy size is due to the accumulation of hydrogen isotope-induced cloud formation by the expansion (from the mass of a galaxy to zero) of other giant stars. As the increase of mass over a short period of time is greater among stars with a lower mass concentration, this can be seen as a cause of increased cloud generation. The mass increase is also a consequence of an orbital phase transition during which the galaxy itself was smaller and the surrounding space around it is more compact. Indeed, the amount of dust in the atmosphere during the orbital stage (after the gas evaporates out) is so small that it doesn't distinguish between galaxies (or stars) with the upper upper limit of galaxy mass (that of 0.9%) and those with higher (but much smaller scale) mass levels.

show an upper bound of O(k(n - k) + kc) and a lower bound of {\Omega}(n + kc),
where c is the complexity of the transportation network. This is quite
different from the bound O(k(n - k)) in the Euclidean metric. For the special
case where k = n - 1 the complexity in the Euclidean metric is O(n), while that

A thermally driven out-of-equilibrium two-impurity Kondo system,"  The archetypal two-impurity Kondo problem in a serially-coupled double
quantum dot is investigated in the presence of a thermal bias $\theta$. The
slave-boson formulation is employed to obtain the nonlinear thermal and
thermoelectrical responses. When the Kondo correlations prevail over the
antiferromagnetic coupling $J$ between dot spins we demonstrate that the setup
shows negative differential thermal conductance regions behaving as a thermal
diode. Besides, we report a sign reversal of the thermoelectric current
$I(\theta)$ controlled by $t/\Gamma$ ($t$ and $\Gamma$ denote the interdot
tunnel and reservoir-dot tunnel couplings, respectively) and $\theta$. All
these features are attributed to the fact that at large $\theta$, both
$Q(\theta)$ (heat current) and $I(\theta)$ are suppressed regardless the value
of $t/\Gamma$ because the double dot decouples at high thermal biases.
Eventually, and for a finite $J$, we investigate how the
Kondo-to-antiferromagnetic crossover is altered by $\theta$.

"Do scale-invariant fluctuations imply the breaking of de Sitter
  invariance?","  The quantization of the massless minimally coupled (mmc) scalar field in de
Sitter spacetime is known to be a non-trivial problem due to the appearance of
strong infrared (IR) effects. In particular, the scale-invariance of the CMB
power-spectrum - certainly one of the most successful predictions of modern
cosmology - is widely believed to be inconsistent with a de Sitter invariant
mmc two-point function.
  Using a Cesaro-summability technique to properly define an otherwise
divergent Fourier transform, we show in this Letter that de Sitter symmetry
breaking is \emph{not} a necessary consequence of the scale-invariant

fields, i.e the discrete series of representations of the de Sitter group, that
suffer from similar strong IR effects.

In particular, we aim at designing the precoding vectors solving the so-called
quality of service (QoS) and weighted max-min fairness (MMF) problems, assuming
that the channel state information is available at the base station (BS). To
solve both problems, the baseline approach exploits the semidefinite relaxation

than $\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$, which prevents its application in large-scale

algorithms that, not only have significantly lower computational complexity
than existing solutions, but also largely outperform the SDR based methods.
Moreover, we present a novel duality between transformed versions of the QoS
and the weighted MMF problems. The duality explicitly determines the solution
to the weighted MMF problem given the solution to the QoS problem, and vice
versa. Numerical results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed

Delay Optimal Secrecy in Two-Relay Network,"  We consider a two-relay network in which a source aims to communicate a
confidential message to a destination while keeping the message secret from the
relay nodes. In the first hop, the channels from the source to the relays are
assumed to be block-fading and the channel states change arbitrarily -possibly
non-stationary and non-ergodic- across blocks. When the relay feedback on the
states of the source-to-relay channels is available on the source with no
delay, we provide an encoding strategy to achieve the optimal delay. We next
consider the case in which there is one-block delayed relay feedback on the
states of the source-to-relay channels. We show that for a set of channel state
sequences, the optimal delay with one-block delayed feedback differs from the
optimal delay with no-delayed feedback at most one block.

The Planar Slope Number of Planar Partial 3-Trees of Bounded Degree,"  It is known that every planar graph has a planar embedding where edges are
represented by non-crossing straight-line segments. We study the planar slope
number, i.e., the minimum number of distinct edge-slopes in such a drawing of a
planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$. We show that the planar slope number
of every planar partial 3-tree and also every plane partial 3-tree is at most
$O(\Delta^5)$. In particular, we answer the question of Dujmovi\'c et al.

The Silver Lining Around Fearful Living,"  This paper discusses in layperson's terms human and computational studies of
the impact of threat and fear on exploration and creativity. A first study
showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without
predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of
new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve. However, for the
fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take
longer. This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior
varying only one parameter, the fear parameter. A second study showed that
stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than
stories inspired by non-threatening photographs. Various explanations for the
findings are discussed.

"Ferromagnetic resonance force spectroscopy of individual sub-micron size

perform ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy of \emph{individual}
sub-micron size samples. We restrict our attention to a thorough study of the
spin-wave eigen-modes excited in permalloy (Py) disks patterned out of the same
43.3 nm thin film. The disks have a diameter of either 1.0 or $0.5 \mu$m and
are quasi-saturated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field. It is shown
that \emph{quantitative} spectroscopic information can be extracted from the
MRFM measurements. In particular, the data are extensively compared with
complementary approximate models of the dynamical susceptibility: i) a 2D
analytical model, which assumes an homogeneous magnetization dynamics along the
thickness and ii) a full 3D micromagnetic simulation, which assumes an
homogeneous magnetization dynamics below a characteristic length scale $c$ and
which approximates the cylindrical sample volume by a discretized
representation with regular cubic mesh of lateral size $c=3.9$ nm. In our
analysis, the distortions due to a breaking of the axial symmetry are taken
into account, both models incorporating the possibility of a small misalignment
between the applied field and the normal of the disks.

The extraction of parameters from final state interactions,"  It is argued that final state enhancements in production reactions at large
momentum transfers, such as pp -> K^+ Lambda p, are primarily sensitive to the
position of a virtual bound state pole in the Lambda p system rather than the
Lambda p scattering length and effective range. These arguments are supported
by a study of the dispersion relation derived to describe such processes as a
function of the cut-off energy. This shows that the position of the virtual
bound state is independent of the cut-off energy.
","The extraction of parameters from final state interactions is essential in the evolution of the complex interplay of molecules, which, as a consequence of an inter-layer interaction with an intervening and subsequently removed nonlocally relevant chemical, is the key for the formation of a complex system.

Leverage and Uncertainty,"  Risk and uncertainty will always be a matter of experience, luck, skills, and

decisions and results. Adaptive skills and quantitative probabilistic methods
need to be used in successful management of risk, uncertainty and leverage. The
author explores how uncertainty beyond risk determines consistent leverage in a
simple model of the world with fat tails due to significant, not fully
quantifiable and not too rare events. Among particular technical results, for
the single asset fractional Kelly criterion is derived in the presence of the
fat tails associated with subjective uncertainty. For the multi-asset
portfolio, Kelly criterion provides an insightful perspective on Risk Parity
strategies, which can be extended for the assets with fat tails.

Quench action and Renyi entropies in integrable systems,"  Entropy is a fundamental concept in equilibrium statistical mechanics, yet
its origin in the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems is not
fully understood. A strong consensus is emerging around the idea that the
stationary thermodynamic entropy is the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a
large subsystem embedded in an infinite system. Also motivated by cold-atom
experiments, here we consider the generalisation to Renyi entropies. We develop
a new technique to calculate the diagonal Renyi entropy in the quench action
formalism. In the spirit of the replica treatment for the entanglement entropy,
the diagonal Renyi entropies are generalised free energies evaluated over a
thermodynamic macrostate which depends on the Renyi index and, in particular,
it is not the same describing the von Neumann entropy. The technical reason for
this, maybe surprising, result is that the evaluation of the moments of the
diagonal density matrix shifts the saddle point of the quench action. An
interesting consequence is that different Renyi entropies encode information
about different regions of the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian. Our
approach provides a very simple proof of the long-standing issue that, for
integrable systems, the diagonal entropy is half of the thermodynamic one and
it allows us to generalise this result to the case of arbitrary Renyi entropy.

simulations of a meshless membrane model combined with anchored linear polymer
chains. The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for
anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains. Our results are in good
agreement with the previous theoretical predictions. It is found that the
polymer reduces the line tension of membrane edges, as well as the interfacial
line tension between membrane domains, leading to microdomain formation.
Instead of the mixing of two phases as observed in typical binary fluids,
densely anchored polymers stabilize small domains. A mean field theory is
proposed for the edge line tension reduced by anchored ideal chains, which

"Lightweight Monte Carlo Verification of Markov Decision Processes with

problems, but are often intractable for exhaustive verification methods. Recent
work has introduced lightweight approximative techniques that sample directly
from scheduler space, bringing the prospect of scalable alternatives to
standard numerical model checking algorithms. The focus so far has been on
optimising the probability of a property, but many problems require
quantitative analysis of rewards. In this work we therefore present lightweight

Did GW150914 produce a rotating gravastar?,"  The interferometric LIGO detectors have recently measured the first direct
gravitational-wave signal from what has been interpreted as the inspiral,
merger and ringdown of a binary system of black holes. The signal-to-noise
ratio of the measured signal is large enough to leave little doubt that it does
refer to the inspiral of two massive and ultracompact objects, whose merger
yields a rotating black hole. Yet, the quality of the data is such that some
room is left for alternative interpretations that do not involve black holes,
but other objects that, within classical general relativity, can be equally
massive and compact, namely, gravastars. We here consider the hypothesis that
the merging objects were indeed gravastars and explore whether the merged
object could therefore be not a black hole but a rotating gravastar. After
comparing the real and imaginary parts of the ringdown signal of GW150914 with
the corresponding quantities for a variety of gravastars, and notwithstanding
the very limited knowledge of the perturbative response of rotating gravastars,
we conclude it is not possible to model the measured ringdown of GW150914 as
due to a rotating gravastar.
","Did GW150914 produce a rotating gravastar?

Nope. Just making up a position so that all the planets at the moment are in a similar position will not produce the required force.
 (This seems likely, but the paper is definitely more likely to be refuted by another method.)
. However, not everyone has said: the reason why a rotor only produces an angular acceleration is to reduce planetary orbitals and provide an easy route on earth for the spin axis to reach the destination. I am aware of some people being skeptical of this. So I made this argument for a way of moving the planet on the surface. This can only be done by rotating the solar wind around the Sun instead of by taking a big rotation in one particular direction.

Inter-relationship between the Two Emission Cones of B1237+25,"  The origin of two distinct pairs of conal emission components in pulsars,
associated with the ""outer"" and the ""inner"" emission cones, as well as the
marked difference in their observed spectral properties, is poorly understood.
The sub-pulse modulation in the corresponding conal components, if mapped back
to the underlying system of sub-beams rotating around the magnetic axis in the
polar cap, as envisioned by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975), provides a potential
way to investigate the emission morphologies in the two conal regions, and more
importantly, any inter-relationship between them. The bright pulsar B1237+25
with its special viewing geometry where the sightline traverses almost through
the magnetic axis, along with a rich variety in pulse-to-pulse fluctuations,
provides an excellent, but challenging opportunity to map the underlying
emission patterns across the full transverse slice of its polar emission
region. We present here our analysis on a number of pulse-sequences from this
star to map and study any relationship between the underlying patterns
responsible for emission in the two pairs of presumed conal-components and a
core-component of this pulsar. The results from our correlation analysis of the
two conal emission patterns strongly support the view that the two cones of
this pulsar (the outer and the inner cone) originate from a common system of
sub-beams. We also see evidence for a twist in the emission columns, most
likely associated with a corresponding twist in the magnetic field structure.
We discuss these results, and their implications, including a possibility that
the core component of this pulsar shares its origin partly with the conal
counterparts.
","Inter-relationship between the Two Emission Cones of B1237+25% in UH12-30% and the Emissions Emissivity of C-P-13% is discussed here. Because the present model has only three separate models that have a strong relationship between energy content of CO2 (including both CO 2 and CO 3 ) and emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced by the coal plants, the results from this study may be less accurate in modeling the future of coal use in California [ 9 ] than would occur under a single emissions accounting. Specifically, because both energy-use and GTP CO-E emissions per unit of GDP are associated with the current energy profile, we would expect to see CO emissions for two-thirds of U.S. coal consumption in 2025 when both GHG and ENI are included. As has been shown from previous studies, climate change and its impact on the world's climate system often play a role in the selection of targets, and any such impact will depend on a combination of a mix of factors (e.g., changes in atmospheric and oceanospheric carbon balance); therefore, an accounting of potential effects such as GTR (greenhouse-gas sequestration) on emissions from coal would be a major way to",0.2404002063055139,0.16140350377691612,0.19305717947226664

Noncommutative Plurisubharmonic Polynomials Part I: Global Assumptions,"  We consider symmetric polynomials, p, in the noncommutative free variables
(x_1, x_2, ..., x_g). We define the noncommutative complex hessian of p and we
call a noncommutative symmetric polynomial noncommutative plurisubharmonic if
it has a noncommutative complex hessian that is positive semidefinite when
evaluated on all tuples of n x n matrices for every size n. In this paper, we
show that the symmetric noncommutative plurisubharmonic polynomials are
precisely the noncommutative convex polynomials with a noncommutative analytic
change of variables; i.e., a noncommutative symmetric polynomial, p, is
noncommutative plurisubharmonic if and only if it has the form p = \sum f_j^T
f_j + \sum k_j k_j^T + F + F^T where the sums are finite and f_j, k_j, F are
all noncommutative analytic. We also present a theory of noncommutative
integration for noncommutative polynomials and we prove a noncommutative
version of the Frobenius theorem. A subsequent paper by Greene proves that if
the noncommutative complex hessian of p takes positive semidefinite values on a
""noncommutative open set"" then the noncommutative complex hessian takes
positive semidefinite values on all matrix tuples. Thus, p has the form above.
The proof in the subsequent paper draws on most of the theorems in this paper
together with a very different technique involving representations of
noncommutative quadratic functions.

"An iterative aggregation and disaggregation approach to the calculation
  of steady-state distributions of continuous processes","  A mapping of the process on a continuous configuration space to the symbolic
representation of the motion on a discrete state space will be combined with an
iterative aggregation and disaggregation (IAD) procedure to obtain steady state
distributions of the process. The IAD speeds up the convergence to the unit
eigenvector, which is the steady state distribution, by forming smaller
aggregated matrices whose unit eigenvector solutions are used to refine
approximations of the steady state vector until convergence is reached. This

single crystalline low dimensional wires of Yittrium based Pyrochlore Iridates.
We demonstrate electric field induced nonlinear hysteretic switching of the
density wave at low temperature, followed by smooth nonlinear conduction at
higher temperature (T > 40 K) in $Y_{2-x}Bi_{x}Ir_{2}O_{7}$ with x = 0 and 0.3.
AC transport measurements reveal the presence of four different collective
relaxation processes which dominate at different temperature scales. There is a
strong coupling of the normal charge carriers with the density wave condensate,
which is reflected in the linear scaling of the dc conductivity with the
collective relaxation rate across a wide range of frequency and temperature
regime. The evidence of density wave in low dimensional single crystals of
Pyrochlore Iridate could be a precursor to the possible experimental

Stokes flow near the contact line of an evaporating drop,"  The evaporation of sessile drops in quiescent air is usually governed by
vapour diffusion. For contact angles below $90^\circ$, the evaporative flux
from the droplet tends to diverge in the vicinity of the contact line.
Therefore, the description of the flow inside an evaporating drop has remained
a challenge. Here, we focus on the asymptotic behaviour near the pinned contact
line, by analytically solving the Stokes equations in a wedge geometry of
arbitrary contact angle. The flow field is described by similarity solutions,
with exponents that match the singular boundary condition due to evaporation.
We demonstrate that there are three contributions to the flow in a wedge: the
evaporative flux, the downward motion of the liquid-air interface and the
eigenmode solution which fulfils the homogeneous boundary conditions. Below a
critical contact angle of $133.4^\circ$, the evaporative flux solution will
dominate, while above this angle the eigenmode solution dominates. We
demonstrate that for small contact angles, the velocity field is very
accurately described by the lubrication approximation. For larger contact
angles, the flow separates into regions where the flow is reversing towards the
drop centre.

"Exploiting Active Subspaces in Global Optimization: How Complex is your
  Problem?","  When applying optimization method to a real-world problem, the possession of
prior knowledge and preliminary analysis on the landscape of a global
optimization problem can give us an insight into the complexity of the problem.
This knowledge can better inform us in deciding what optimization method should
be used to tackle the problem. However, this analysis becomes problematic when
the dimensionality of the problem is high. This paper presents a framework to
take a deeper look at the global optimization problem to be tackled: by
analyzing the low-dimensional representation of the problem through discovering
the active subspaces of the given problem. The virtue of this is that the
problem's complexity can be visualized in a one or two-dimensional plot, thus
allow one to get a better grip about the problem's difficulty. One could then
have a better idea regarding the complexity of their problem to determine the
choice of global optimizer or what surrogate-model type to be used.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate how the active subspaces can be used to
perform design exploration and analysis.

Two liquid states of matter: A new dynamic line on a phase diagram,"  It is generally agreed that the supercritical region of a liquid consists of
one single state (supercritical fluid). On the other hand, we show here that
liquids in this region exist in two qualitatively different states: ""rigid"" and
""non-rigid"" liquid. Rigid to non-rigid transition corresponds to the condition
{\tau} ~ {\tau}0, where {\tau}is liquid relaxation time and {\tau}0 is the
minimal period of transverse quasi-harmonic waves. This condition defines a new
dynamic line on the phase diagram, and corresponds to the loss of shear
stiffness of a liquid at all available frequencies, and consequently to the
qualitative change of many important liquid properties. We analyze the dynamic
line theoretically as well as in real and model liquids, and show that the
transition corresponds to the disappearance of high-frequency sound,
qualitative changes of diffusion and viscous flow, increase of particle thermal
speed to half of the speed of sound and reduction of the constant volume
specific heat to 2kB per particle. In contrast to the Widom line that exists
near the critical point only, the new dynamic line is universal: it separates
two liquid states at arbitrarily high pressure and temperature, and exists in
systems where liquid - gas transition and the critical point are absent
overall.

"Impact of Grain Boundaries on Efficiency and Stability of
  Organic-Inorganic Trihalide Perovskites","  Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous attention
because of their remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). To
further improve the device performance, however, it is imperative to obtain
fundamental understandings on the photo-response and long-term stability down
to the microscopic level. Here, we report the first quantitative nanoscale
photoconductivity imaging on two methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) thin
films with different PCEs by light-stimulated microwave impedance microscopy.
The intrinsic photo-response is largely uniform across grains and grain
boundaries, which is direct evidence on the inherently benign nature of
microstructures in the perovskite thin films. In contrast, the carrier mobility
and lifetime are strongly affected by bulk properties such as the sample
crystallinity. As visualized by the spatial evolution of local
photoconductivity, the degradation due to water diffusion through the capping
layer begins with the disintegration of large grains rather than the nucleation
and propagation from grain boundaries. Our findings provide new insights to
improve the electro-optical properties of MAPbI3 thin films towards large-scale
commercialization.

"Density Estimation in Uncertainty Propagation Problems Using a Surrogate
  Model","  The effect of uncertainties and noise on a quantity of interest (model
output) is often better described by its probability density function (PDF)
than by its moments. Although density estimation is a common task, the adequacy
of approximation methods (surrogate models) for density estimation has not been
analyzed before in the uncertainty-quantification (UQ) literature. In this
paper, we first show that standard surrogate models (such as generalized
polynomial chaos), which are highly accurate for moment estimation, might
completely fail to approximate the PDF, even for one-dimensional noise. This is
because density estimation requires that the surrogate model accurately
approximates the gradient of the quantity of interest, and not just the
quantity of interest itself. Hence, we develop a novel spline-based algorithm
for density-estimation whose convergence rate in $L^q$ is polynomial in the
sampling resolution. This convergence rate is better than that of standard
statistical density-estimation methods (such as histograms and kernel density
estimators) at dimensions $1 \leq d\leq \frac{5}{2}m$, where $m$ is the spline
order. Furthermore, we obtain the convergence rate for density estimation with
any surrogate model that approximates the quantity of interest and its gradient
in $L^{\infty}$. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm for problems in
nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics.
","Density Estimation in Uncertainty Propagation Problems Using a Surrogate

In the case of error prediction, there is good enough evidence to use the best known possible distribution with the highest probability in order to allow the assumption of randomness to make sense of experimental conditions.

Small-Time Asymptotics of Option Prices and First Absolute Moments,"  We study the leading term in the small-time asymptotics of at-the-money call
option prices when the stock price process $S$ follows a general martingale.
This is equivalent to studying the first centered absolute moment of $S$. We
show that if $S$ has a continuous part, the leading term is of order $\sqrt{T}$
in time $T$ and depends only on the initial value of the volatility.
Furthermore, the term is linear in $T$ if and only if $S$ is of finite
variation. The leading terms for pure-jump processes with infinite variation
are between these two cases; we obtain their exact form for stable-like small
jumps. To derive these results, we use a natural approximation of $S$ so that
calculations are necessary only for the class of L\'evy processes.

Retrolensing by a wormhole at deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$,"  The deflection angle of a light ray can be arbitrarily large near a light
sphere. The time-symmetrical shape of light curves of a pair of light rays
reflected by a light sphere of a lens object does not depend on the details of
the lens object. We consider retrolensing light curves of sunlight with
deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$ by an Ellis wormhole, which is the simplest
Morris-Thorne wormhole. If an Ellis wormhole with a throat parameter
$a=10^{11}$ km is $100$ pc away from an observer and if the Ellis wormhole, the
observer, and the sun are aligned perfectly in this order, the apparent
magnitudes of a pair of light rays with deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$
become $11$ and $18$, respectively. The two pairs of light rays make a
superposed light curve with two separable peaks and they break down time
symmetry of a retrolensing light curve. The observation of the two separated
peaks of the light curves gives us information on the details of the lens
object. If the observer can also separate the pair of the images with the
deflection angle $\pi$ into a double image, he or she can say whether the
retrolensing is caused by an Ellis wormhole or a Schwarzschild black hole.

"Piecewise Linearity of Approximate Density Functionals Revisited:
  Implications for Frontier Orbital Energies","  In the exact Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), the total energy
versus the number of electrons is a series of linear segments between integer
points. However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total
energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the
ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the
ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise-linearity of an arbitrary
approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the
ensemble generalization of DFT. Furthermore, the resulting formulation
introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate
exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density-dependent.
This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron
affinity even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances
are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying
functional form. The power of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark systems
using the local density approximation as an illustrative example.

extensively studied to be utilized in various optical and optoelectronic
systems such as lenses, solar cells, photodetectors, and others. The growing
interest to all-dielectric photonics as an alternative optical technology along
with plasmonics motivates us to compare antireflection properties of
all-dielectric and plasmonic nanoparticle coatings based on silver and
crystalline silicon. Our results of numerical simulations for periodic arrays
of spherical nanoparticles on top of amorphous silicon show that both silicon
and silver nanoparticle coatings demonstrate strong anti-reflective properties
in the visible spectral range. In this work, we show for the first time that
blooming effect, that is zero reflection from the structure, with silicon
coatings originates from the interference of electric- and magnetic-dipole
responses of nanoparticles with the wave reflected from the substrate, and we
refer to it as substrate-mediated Kerker effect. For the silver coating, our
results agree with previously observed substrate-induced bi-anisotropy and
blooming, caused by substrate-induced magnetic response. Finally, we
numerically show high effectiveness of silicon and silver coatings for the
application in thin-film photovoltaic elements, which is related to the
suppression of reflection from the high-index substrate and increased light
absorbance in the active layer with coating. Depending on the nanoparticle
size, either silicon or silver coating is more efficient, and overall increase
of absorption up to 30% can be achieved.
","Plasmonic and silicon spherical nanoparticle anti-reflective coatings offer effective protection against sunburn.

To investigate sun exposure to silicon particles in vivo, we employed two different modes of experiment: in vitro or in a control paradigm. In vitro treatment with UV/ADC had the advantage of greatly reducing the UV irradiance and was found to prolong skin damage. We found this to be the most effective method of antiadhesive treatment, while in the control, most of the efficacy was attributed to the antioxidant effects of calcium and iron (Supplementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, the effect of UV light and the presence of solar interference has been demonstrated in laboratory tests. Although in practice UV exposure was much less than that of typical sun conditions (1), with the average exposure of 1,800 hours, solar irradiation is highly variable (22). This is due to solar and cosmic radiation fluxes (24). For example, on average, a dose from 200-300 micro meters per second (Mt/m2) to less then 0.1 mW for the 10-μm UV area",0.2459058147719772,0.16030533855340612,0.1716294458229942
Well-posedness of the hydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations,"  We address the local well-posedness of the hydrostatic Navier-Stokes
equations. These equations, sometimes called reduced Navier-Stokes/Prandtl,
appear as a formal limit of the Navier-Stokes system in thin domains, under
certain constraints on the aspect ratio and the Reynolds number. It is known
that without any structural assumption on the initial data, real-analyticity is
both necessary and sufficient for the local well-posedness of the system. In
this paper we prove that for convex initial data, local well-posedness holds
under simple Gevrey regularity.
","Well-posedness of the hydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations and the generalization of their theory, I propose in my next chapter to the relation between the number system and gravity, where these two are combined, how it is, and how matter-gravitational and total energy are used for the differential equations.

"Thermodynamics of pharmacological action for electron-accepting
  compounds on activated or damaged cell in the context of Ling's model of the
  living cell","  The theory describing action of medicines explored in this paper is based on
assumption that vital activity of the cell may be described in terms of the
model of two states: resting state and excitation. According to available
physiological data excitation state is dangerous for cell and may cause
different pathological changes, including ""conformational"" diseases, due to
protein aggregation. Normally, the excitation is completely reversible and the
key role is played here by ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate) which disaggregates
proteins of cytomatrix. The same effect ATP exerts during cell injury by
eliciting a ""healing"" effect. Damage of cell structures we consider as
""illness"", whereas removal of pathological consequences caused by protein
aggregation of any origin we will call ""a cure"". The latter is considered as
physical process of cell recovering from excitation/injury to resting state,
which is analyzed in terms of our generalized thermodynamics. ""Cure"" results in
reduction of effective temperature of cell proteins due to binding
intracellular water which is present in the cell at concentration of
approximately 44 M. As a result of the sorption processes mobility of both
water and proteins is greatly reduced, and the corresponding reduction of the
effective temperature seen by us as a measure of treatment effect.

"Estimation of temperature-dependent growth profiles for the assessment
  of time of hatching in forensic entomology","  Forensic entomology contributes important information to crime scene
investigations. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the hatching
time of larvae (or maggots) based on their lengths, the temperature profile at
the crime scene and experimental data on larval development. This requires the
estimation of a time-dependent growth curve from experiments where larvae have
been exposed to a relatively small number of constant temperature profiles.
Since the temperature influences the developmental speed, a crucial step is the
time alignment of the curves at different temperatures. We propose a model for
time varying temperature profiles based on the local growth rate estimated from
the experimental data. This allows us to estimate the most likely hatching time
for a sample of larvae from the crime scene. Asymptotic properties are provided
for the estimators of the growth curves and the hatching time. We explore via
simulations the robustness of the method to errors in the estimated temperature
profile. We also apply the methodology to data from two criminal cases from the
United Kingdom.
","Estimation of temperature-dependent growth profiles for the assessment
  of time of hatching in forensic entomology remains problematic. A typical (mean length 7.3 m for females) specimen was recovered around 2003 and a similar specimen dated to 2004. However, the average length in specimens obtained in the last decade of the 20th century was not statistically different from the present estimates for average lengths of all the samples. Therefore, our results do not indicate that the time to hatch in an entomycetal entomedicoster has been greater than a standard deviation (SD) value of 0.03. As long that time has elapsed, we assumed that most eggs recovered in maternally related populations were not from moths (or were obtained from other males). However this assumption was violated by comparing molt counts among different middelges",0.26667184981550207,0.15624999500000017,0.18844832325453548

for lattice paths constrained in the half plane. The beautiful cycle method
which was developed by Devoretzky and Motzkin as a means to prove the ballot

We also show some results related to equidistribution properties in terms of
Narayana and Catalan generating functions. We then develop generalized

an exact multisphere superposition scattering solution can be used to fit
holograms of colloidal clusters containing up to six spheres. We also introduce
an approximate and computationally simpler solution, Mie superposition, that is
valid for multiple spheres spaced several wavelengths or more from one another.

Software Distribution Transparency and Auditability,"  A large user base relies on software updates provided through package
managers. This provides a unique lever for improving the security of the

system is capable of detecting targeted backdoors without producing overhead
for maintainers. In addition, in our system, the availability of source code is
ensured, the binding between source and binary code is verified using
reproducible builds, and the maintainer responsible for distributing a specific
package can be identified. We describe a novel ""hidden version"" attack against
current software transparency systems and propose as well as integrate a
suitable defense. To address equivocation attacks by the transparency log
server, we introduce tree root cross logging, where the log's Merkle tree root
is submitted into a separately operated log server. This significantly relaxes
the inter-operator cooperation requirements compared to other systems. Our
implementation is evaluated by replaying over 3000 updates of the Debian
operating system over the course of two years, demonstrating its viability and
identifying numerous irregularities.

On transverse stability of discrete line solitons,"  We obtain sharp criteria for transverse stability and instability of line
solitons in the discrete nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations on one- and
two-dimensional lattices near the anti-continuum limit. On a two-dimensional
lattice, the fundamental line soliton is proved to be transversely stable
(unstable) when it bifurcates from the $X$ ($\Gamma$) point of the dispersion
surface. On a one-dimensional (stripe) lattice, the fundamental line soliton is
proved to be transversely unstable for both signs of transverse dispersion. If
this transverse dispersion has the opposite sign to the discrete dispersion,
the instability is caused by a resonance between isolated eigenvalues of
negative energy and the continuous spectrum of positive energy. These results
hold for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities via a staggering
transformation. When the line soliton is transversely unstable, asymptotic
expressions for unstable eigenvalues are also derived. These analytical results
are compared with numerical results, and perfect agreement is obtained.

Approximate joint measurements of qubit observables,"  Joint measurements of qubit observables have recently been studied in
conjunction with quantum information processing tasks such as cloning.
Considerations of such joint measurements have until now been restricted to a
certain class of observables that can be characterized by a form of covariance.
Here we investigate conditions for the joint measurability of arbitrary pairs
of qubit observables. For pairs of noncommuting sharp qubit observables, a
notion of approximate joint measurement is introduced. Optimal approximate
joint measurements are shown to lie in the class of covariant joint
measurements. The marginal observables found to be optimal approximators are
generally not among the coarse-grainings of the observables to be approximated.
This yields scope for the improvement of existing joint measurement schemes.

"Theory of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of
  strong-field-generated ions","  Strong-field ionization generally produces ions in a superposition of ionic
eigenstates. This superposition is generally not fully coherent und must be
described in terms of a density matrix. A recent experiment [E. Goulielmakis et
al., Nature 466, 739 (2010)] employed attosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy to determine the density matrix of strong-field-generated Kr+
ions. The experimentally observed degree of coherence of the
strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is well reproduced by a recently developed
multichannel strong-field-ionization theory. But there is significant
disagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of
alignment of the Kr+ ions. In the present paper, the theory underlying
attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is
developed. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative
nature of the strong-field-ionization process is systematically taken into
account. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the
interpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and
numerically. It is shown that attosecond pulse propagation effects cannot
explain why the experimentally determined degree of alignment of
strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is much smaller than predicted by existing
theory.
","Theory of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of
  strong-field-generated ions is of great interest. It is an important theoretical issue and deserves major attention. However, in the scientific literature, the precise interpretation of the theoretical concept is not always clear and it can be difficult to understand the exact model, and, for an accurate understanding of some theories of ion absorption and the effects of a strong field on an ion, can take several years to develop. Some examples would provide a model whereby a solid ion can survive with a weak weak field.

A fundamental feature of natural ion theory is that a powerful ion is never more powerful than after a change in temperature.

"Effective chiral magnetic currents, topological magnetic charges, and
  microwave vortices in a cavity with an enclosed ferrite disk","  In microwaves, a TE-polarized rectangular-waveguide resonator with an
inserted thin ferrite disk gives an example of a nonintegrable system. The
interplay of reflection and transmission at the disk interfaces together with
the material gyrotropy effect gives rise to whirlpool-like electromagnetic
vortices in the proximity of the ferromagnetic resonance. Based on numerical
simulation, we show that a character of microwave vortices in a cavity can be
analyzed by means of consideration of equivalent magnetic currents. Maxwell
equations allows introduction of a magnetic current as a source of the
electromagnetic field. Specifically, we found that in such nonintegrable
structures, magnetic gyrotropy and geometrical factors leads to the effect of
symmetry breaking resulting in effective chiral magnetic currents and
topological magnetic charges. As an intriguing fact, one can observe precessing
behavior of the electric-dipole polarization inside a ferrite disk.

observations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update stage guarantees
the real-time performance of the solution while maintaining good registration
even when the image sequence is contaminated by noise, gross data corruption,

Reinforcement Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations,"  Robust real-world learning should benefit from both demonstrations and
interactions with the environment. Current approaches to learning from
demonstration and reward perform supervised learning on expert demonstration
data and use reinforcement learning to further improve performance based on the
reward received from the environment. These tasks have divergent losses which
are difficult to jointly optimize and such methods can be very sensitive to
noisy demonstrations. We propose a unified reinforcement learning algorithm,
Normalized Actor-Critic (NAC), that effectively normalizes the Q-function,
reducing the Q-values of actions unseen in the demonstration data. NAC learns
an initial policy network from demonstrations and refines the policy in the
environment, surpassing the demonstrator's performance. Crucially, both
learning from demonstration and interactive refinement use the same objective,
unlike prior approaches that combine distinct supervised and reinforcement
losses. This makes NAC robust to suboptimal demonstration data since the method
is not forced to mimic all of the examples in the dataset. We show that our
unified reinforcement learning algorithm can learn robustly and outperform
existing baselines when evaluated on several realistic driving games.

In the second part of this series, Reinforcement learning from human trials from imperfect training has been used to improve performance and speed.

The subject also receives a random chance (or 'random chance') to take part in the trial in question. If the subjects fail to complete the imperfect sentence quickly enough the researchers might decide to start an automatic trial for them.

"Mobile Geometric Graphs: Detection, Coverage and Percolation","  We consider the following dynamic Boolean model introduced by van den Berg,
Meester and White (1997). At time 0, let the nodes of the graph be a Poisson
point process in R^d with constant intensity and let each node move
independently according to Brownian motion. At any time t, we put an edge
between every pair of nodes if their distance is at most r. We study three
features in this model: detection (the time until a target point---fixed or
moving---is within distance r from some node of the graph), coverage (the time
until all points inside a finite box are detected by the graph), and
percolation (the time until a given node belongs to the infinite connected
component of the graph). We obtain precise asymptotics for these features by
combining ideas from stochastic geometry, coupling and multi-scale analysis.

"Muons enhancements at sea level in association with Swift-BAT and
  MILAGRO triggers","  Recently, triggers occurring during high background rate intervals have been
reporter by Swift-BAT Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) detector. Among them, there were
two on January 24, two on January 25, and two on February 13, and 18, all in
2008. These Swift-BAT triggers in most cases are probably noise triggers that
occurred while Swift was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). In fact, we
show that they happen during a plentiful precipitation of high energy particles
in the SAA, producing muons in the atmosphere detected by two directional
telescopes at sea level, inside the SAA region (Tupi experiment). They look
like sharp peaks in the muon counting rate. In the same category are two
triggers from MILAGRO ground based detector, on January 25 and 31, 2008
respectively. In addition, the trigger coordinates are close to (and, in two
cases, inside) the field of view of the telescopes. From an additional analysis
in the behavior of the muon counting rate, it is possible to conclude that the
events are produced by precipitation of high energy charged particles in the
SAA region. Thus, due to its localization, the Tupi experiment constitutes a
new sensor of high energy particle precipitation in the SAA, and it can be
useful in the identification of some triggers of Gamma Ray Burst detectors.

to neon boiling temperatures ($\sim 30$ K), as compared with photon generation

"Fisher information analysis of list-mode SPECT emission data for joint
  estimation of activity and attenuation distribution","  The potential to perform attenuation and scatter compensation (ASC) in
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using only the SPECT
emission data is highly significant. In this context, attenuation in SPECT is
primarily due to Compton scattering, where the probability of Compton scatter
is proportional to the attenuation coefficient of the tissue and the energy of
the scattered photon and the scattering angle are related. Given this premise,
we investigate whether the SPECT scattered-photon data acquired in list-mode
(LM) format and including the energy information can be used to estimate the
attenuation map. For this purpose, we propose a Fisher-information-based method
that yields the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the task of jointly estimating the
activity/attenuation distribution using only the SPECT emission data. The
proposed method is applied to analyze the information content of SPECT LM
emission data in a 2D SPECT system using computational studies with digital
phantoms for different photon-count levels. The results show that scattered
photons contain information to estimate the attenuation coefficients. An
increase in the number of detected photons leads to lower CRB for both the
attenuation and activity coefficients. Also, the CRB obtained for the
attenuation and activity coefficients is typically much lower than the true
value of these coefficients. Further, processing the emission data in LM format
yields a lower CRB in comparison to binning data. Finally, we observe that
systems with better energy resolution yield a lower CRB for the attenuation
coefficient. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that LM SPECT
emission data, including the scattered photons, contains information to jointly
estimate the activity and attenuation coefficients.

"A Critical Centre-Stable Manifold for the Cubic Focusing Schroedinger
  Equation in Three Dimensions","  Consider the H^{1/2}-critical Schroedinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity
in R^3, i \partial_t \psi + \Delta \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi = 0. It admits an
eight-dimensional manifold of periodic solutions called solitons e^{i(\Gamma +
vx - t|v|^2 + \alpha^2 t)} \phi(x-2tv-D, \alpha), where \phi(x, \alpha) is a
positive ground state solution of the semilinear elliptic equation -\Delta \phi
+ \alpha^2\phi = \phi^3. We prove that in the neighborhood of the soliton
manifold there exists a H^{1/2} real analytic manifold N of asymptotically
stable solutions of the Schroedinger equation, meaning they are the sum of a
moving soliton and a dispersive term. Furthermore, a solution starting on N
remains on N for all positive time and for some finite negative time and N can
be identified as the centre-stable manifold for this equation. The proof is
based on the method of modulation, introduced by Soffer and Weinstein and
adapted by Schlag to the L^2-supercritical case. Novel elements include a
different linearization and new Strichartz-type estimates for the linear
Schroedinger equation. The main result depends on a spectral assumption
concerning the absence of embedded eigenvalues. We also establish several new
estimates for solutions of the time-dependent and time-independent linear
Schroedinger equation, which hold under sharper or more general conditions than
previously known. Several of these estimates are based on a new approach that
makes use of Wiener's Theorem in the context of function spaces.

Information storage capacity of discrete spin systems,"  Understanding the limits imposed on information storage capacity of physical
systems is a problem of fundamental and practical importance which bridges
physics and information science. There is a well-known upper bound on the
amount of information that can be stored reliably in a given volume of discrete
spin systems which are supported by gapped local Hamiltonians. However, all the
previously known systems were far below this theoretical bound, and it remained
open whether there exists a gapped spin system that saturates this bound. Here,
we present a construction of spin systems which saturate this theoretical limit
asymptotically by borrowing an idea from fractal properties arising in the
Sierpinski triangle. Our construction provides not only the best classical
error-correcting code which is physically realizable as the energy ground space
of gapped frustration-free Hamiltonians, but also a new research avenue for
correlated spin phases with fractal spin configurations.

It is desirable that data stored within a system is spread over a distance within that process that is distributed to different processors.

"On the age and formation mechanism of the core of the Quadrantid
  meteoroid stream","  The Quadrantid meteor shower is among the strongest annual meteor showers,
and has drawn the attention of scientists for several decades. The stream is
unusual, among others, for several reasons: its very short duration around
maximum activity (~12 - 14 hours) as detected by visual, photographic and radar
observations, its recent onset (around 1835 AD) and because it had been the
only major stream without an obvious parent body until 2003. Ever since, there
have been debates as to the age of the stream and the nature of its proposed
parent body, asteroid 2003 EH1.
  In this work, we present results on the most probable age and formation
mechanism of the narrow portion of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream. For the
first time we use data on eight high precision photographic Quadrantids,
equivalent to gram - kilogram size, to constrain the most likely age of the
core of the stream. Out of eight high-precision photographic Quadrantids, five
pertain directly to the narrow portion of the stream. In addition, we also use
data on five high-precision radar Quadrantids, observed within the peak of the
shower.
  We performed backwards numerical integrations of the equations of motion of a
large number of 'clones' of both, the eight high-precision photographic and
five radar Quadrantid meteors, along with the proposed parent body, 2003 EH1.
According to our results, from the backward integrations, the most likely age
of the narrow structure of the Quadrantids is between 200 - 300 years. These
presumed ejection epochs, corresponding to 1700 - 1800 AD, are then used for
forward integrations of large numbers of hypothetical meteoroids, ejected from
the parent 2003 EH$_1$, until the present epoch. The aim is to constrain
whether the core of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream is consistent with a
previously proposed relatively young age (~ 200 years).}
","On the age and formation mechanism of the core of the Quadrantid
  meteoroid stream in Fig. 3, the nebula has been hypothesized to produce a sub-atomic core, a non-collapseable core with a dense cloud of hydrogen, helium, and helium within which the atomoids, each orbiting the same boundary unit, form.

Robust Stackelberg game in communication systems,"  This paper studies multi-user communication systems with two groups of users:
leaders which possess system information, and followers which have no system
information using the formulation of Stackelberg games. In such games, the
leaders play and choose their actions based on their information about the
system and the followers choose their actions myopically according to their
observations of the aggregate impact of other users. However, obtaining the
exact value of these parameters is not practical in communication systems. To
study the effect of uncertainty and preserve the players' utilities in these
conditions, we introduce a robust equilibrium for Stackelberg games. In this
framework, the leaders' information and the followers' observations are
uncertain parameters, and the leaders and the followers choose their actions by
solving the worst-case robust optimizations. We show that the followers'
uncertain parameters always increase the leaders' utilities and decrease the
followers' utilities. Conversely, the leaders' uncertain information reduces
the leaders' utilities and increases the followers' utilities. We illustrate
our theoretical results with the numerical results obtained based on the power
control games in the interference channels.

taken with NuSTAR and Suzaku. This is the first report of a NuSTAR observation
of Cyg X-1 in the intermediate state, and the observation was taken during the
part of the binary orbit where absorption due to the companion's stellar wind

components. Our initial fits with publicly available constant density

iron abundances have been reported previously for Cyg X-1, our measurements are
much higher and such variability is almost certainly unphysical. Using a new
version of reflionx that we modified to make the electron density a free

"Arbitrary control of the polarization and intensity profiles of
  diffraction-attenuation-resistant beams along their propagation direction","  We report on the theory and experimental generation of a class of
diffraction-attenuation-resistant beams with state of polarization (SoP) and
intensity that can be controlled on demand along the propagation direction.
This is achieved by a suitable superposition of Bessel beams, whose parameters
are systematically chosen based on closed-form analytic expressions provided by
the Frozen Waves (FWs) method. Using an amplitude-only spatial light modulator,
we experimentally demonstrate three scenarios. In the first, the SoP of a
horizontally polarized beam evolves to radial polarization and is then changed
to vertical polarization, with the beam intensity held constant. In the second,
we simultaneously control the SoP and the longitudinal intensity profile, which
was chosen such that the beam's central ring can be switched-off over
predefined space regions, thus generating multiple foci with different SoP and
at different intensity levels along the propagation. Finally, the ability to
control the SoP while overcoming attenuation inside lossy fluids is shown
experimentally for the first time in the literature (to the best of our
knowledge). Therefore, we envision our proposed method to be of great interest
for many applications, such as optical tweezers, atom guiding, material
processing, microscopy, and optical communications.

The beam to absorb the visible light in the beam pattern is then polarized in a more polarized fashion and its absorption is reduced. The dispersion factor for this light wave is the integral of wavelength; hence the term diffractive absorber ratio means the density of light to absorption (dens) and as is common in light absorption, absorbing and refractive coupling in terms of scattering. By changing the dispersive value of a point which has changed wavelength, one also makes use of other modes of operation, such as optics or electronic optics, although this is sometimes called ""percussion",0.288591421360148,0.25423728320597533,0.21328232868238448
"Discriminative variable selection for clustering with the sparse
  Fisher-EM algorithm","  The interest in variable selection for clustering has increased recently due
to the growing need in clustering high-dimensional data. Variable selection
allows in particular to ease both the clustering and the interpretation of the
results. Existing approaches have demonstrated the efficiency of variable
selection for clustering but turn out to be either very time consuming or not
sparse enough in high-dimensional spaces. This work proposes to perform a
selection of the discriminative variables by introducing sparsity in the
loading matrix of the Fisher-EM algorithm. This clustering method has been
recently proposed for the simultaneous visualization and clustering of
high-dimensional data. It is based on a latent mixture model which fits the
data into a low-dimensional discriminative subspace. Three different approaches
are proposed in this work to introduce sparsity in the orientation matrix of
the discriminative subspace through $\ell_{1}$-type penalizations. Experimental
comparisons with existing approaches on simulated and real-world data sets
demonstrate the interest of the proposed methodology. An application to the
segmentation of hyperspectral images of the planet Mars is also presented.

 (r=0, P 1 ) and the non-r-values. When you have a sparse set, you typically find the minimum value for each time term of the random feature of it. This is a rather powerful feature, since the data set that includes this random, has a lot shorter nonlinear variables (say, N), which could lead to biases because you cannot find data that has

Blocked-braid Groups,"  We introduce and study a family of groups $\mathbf{BB}_n$, called the
blocked-braid groups, which are quotients of Artin's braid groups
$\mathbf{B}_n$, and have the corresponding symmetric groups $\Sigma_n$ as
quotients. They are defined by adding a certain class of geometrical
modifications to braids. They arise in the study of commutative Frobenius
algebras and tangle algebras in braided strict monoidal categories. A
fundamental equation true in $\mathbf{BB}_n$ is Dirac's Belt Trick; that
torsion through $4\pi$ is equal to the identity. We show that $\mathbf{BB}_n$
is finite for $n=1,2$ and 3 but infinite for $n>3$.

combined with an efficient embedded linear channel equalization (ELCE)
technique for the Physical layer Network Coding (PNC). Our transmission scheme,
we achieve about 33% increase in the spectral efficiency over the conventional

Some effectivity questions for plane Cremona transformations,"  We give a way of estimating quickly the length of the hyperbolic isometry
associated to a plane Cremona transformation that is presented as the product
of two involutions. We also show, using the ideas of Cantat and Lamy, that,
provided that the ground field is either algebraic of characteristic not 2 or
of characteristic zero, the normal closure of a high power of such a
transformation is a proper subgroup of the Cremona group; this gives an
effective instantiation of some of their results. Moreover, we show that any
hyperbolic Cremona transformation is rigid and give a simple criterion for it
to be tight.
  This version is thoroughly revised from the previous version. In particular,
it corrects an error in an earlier version that was pointed out by Lonjou.

Then a plot of axial rotation was measured. Results showed that, although the plane, axiomatic and mechanical aspects of transveronal rotation in the transposed plane were slightly different, the changes in axion and ratio of axis shifted were no more than inversely proportional to the magnitude of planes in this",0.24950708857809378,0.16666666171926378,0.17753623188405798

"A propeller model for the sub-luminous disk state of the transitional
  millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038","  The discovery of millisecond pulsars switching between states powered either
by the rotation of their magnetic field or by the accretion of matter, has
recently proved the tight link shared by millisecond radio pulsars and neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Transitional millisecond pulsars also show an
enigmatic intermediate state in which the neutron star is surrounded by an
accretion disk, it emits coherent X-ray pulsations, but is sub-luminous in
X-rays with respect to accreting neutron stars, and is brighter in gamma-rays
than millisecond pulsars in the rotation-powered state. Here, we model the
X-ray and gamma-ray emission observed from PSR J1023+0038 in such a state based
on the assumption that most of the disk in-flow is propelled away by the
rapidly rotating neutron star magnetosphere, and that electrons can be
accelerated to energies of a few GeV at the turbulent disk-magnetosphere
boundary. We show that the synchrotron and self-synchrotron Compton emission
coming from such a region, together with the hard disk emission typical of low
states of accreting compact objects, is able to explain the radiation observed
in the X-ray and gamma-ray band. The average emission observed from PSR
J1023+0038 is modelled by a disk in-flow with a rate of $(1-3)\times10^{-11}
M_{\odot}/yr$, truncated at a radius ranging between 30 and 45 km, compatible
with the hypothesis of a propelling magnetosphere. We compare the results we
obtained with models that rather assume that a rotation-powered pulsar is
turned on, showing how the spin down power released in similar scenarios is
hardly able to account for the magnitude of the observed emission.
","A propeller model for the sub-luminous disk state of the transitional
  millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 is shown in Fig 1A, which is a typical case of pulsarians. Its initial phase with respect to a large-scale disk space corresponds to the initial

length of phase of an elementary particle with the mass of a single mass. The spin of PSRs is proportional to their velocity, which we call mass/mass ratio. At low velocity the velocity of this disc depends purely on its spin, and during a long life it will probably remain the same because of such the motion does not depend on the speed.

"Strong electroweak symmetry breaking (or, if no SM Higgs, then what?)","  While the LHC takes on the challenge of experimentally exploring the
electroweak symmetry breaking sector, it is not only interesting but also
crucial to explore alternatives to the Standard Model scenario with an
elementary scalar Higgs boson. The idea of electroweak symmetry breaking by
some new strong dynamics is discussed. A simple, general and self-consistent
low energy effective description of Higgsless models is introduced. This
effective theory is studied from the point of view of prolonging perturbative
unitarity of WW scattering by spin-1 resonances originating from the strongly
interacting sector. The LHC phenomenology and the discovery potential for these
spin-1 resonances is also discussed. The role of spin-1 resonances is then
considered on the grounds of composite Higgs models. A general prescription for
the explicit inclusion of such resonances in the effective Lagrangian
description of these models is presented.

"A compact, metal-rich, kpc-scale outflow in FBQS J0209-0438: Detailed
  diagnostics from HST/COS extreme UV observations","  We present HST/COS observations of highly ionized absorption lines associated
with a radio-loud QSO at $z=1.1319$. The absorption system has multiple
velocity components, tracing gas that is largely outflowing from the QSO at
velocities of a few 100 km s$^{-1}$. There is an unprecedented range in
ionization, with detections of HI, NIII, NIV, NV, OIV, OIV*, OV, OVI, NeVIII,
MgX, SV and ArVIII. We estimate the total hydrogen number density from the
column density ratio N(OIV*)/N(OIV) to be
$\log(n_{\textrm{H}}/\textrm{cm}^3)\sim 3$. Assuming photoionization
equilibrium, we derive a distance to the absorbing complex of $2.3<R<6.0$ kpc
from the centre of the QSO. A range in ionization parameter, covering $\sim 2$
orders of magnitude, suggest absorption path lengths in the range
$10^{-4.5}<l_{\textrm{abs}}<1$ pc. In addition, the absorbing gas only
partially covers the background emission from the QSO continuum, which suggests
clouds with transverse sizes $l_{\textrm{trans}}<10^{-2.5}$ pc. Widely
differing absorption path lengths, combined with covering fractions less than
unity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloud
geometries. These issues may be mitigated by the presence of non-equilibrium
effects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures. The
dynamics and expected lifetimes of the gas clouds suggest that they do not
originate from close to the AGN, but are instead formed close to their observed
location. Their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities are
broadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations in
winds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretion
disc. In the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not trace
the bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as an
accompanying warm absorber, detectable in X-rays.

"Formation, Habitability, and Detection of Extrasolar Moons","  The diversity and quantity of moons in the Solar System suggest a manifold
population of natural satellites exist around extrasolar planets. Of peculiar
interest from an astrobiological perspective, the number of sizable moons in
the stellar habitable zones may outnumber planets in these circumstellar
regions. With technological and theoretical methods now allowing for the
detection of sub-Earth-sized extrasolar planets, the first detection of an
extrasolar moon appears feasible. In this review, we summarize formation
channels of massive exomoons that are potentially detectable with current or
near-future instruments. We discuss the orbital effects that govern exomoon
evolution, we present a framework to characterize an exomoon's stellar plus
planetary illumination as well as its tidal heating, and we address the
techniques that have been proposed to search for exomoons. Most notably, we
show that natural satellites in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 Earth mass (i) are

"Polylogarithmic equilibrium treatment of molecular aggregation and
  critical concentrations","  A full equilibrium treatment of molecular aggregation is presented for
prototypes of 1D and 3D aggregates, with and without nucleation. By skipping
complex kinetic parameters like aggregate size-dependent diffusion, the
equilibrium treatment allows to predict directly time-independent quantities
such as critical concentrations. The relationships between the macroscopic
equilibrium constants for the different paths are first established by
statistical corrections and so as to comply with the detailed balance
constraints imposed by nucleation, and the composition of the mixture resulting
from homogeneous aggregation is then analyzed using the polylogarithm function.
Several critical concentrations are distinguished: the residual monomer
concentation in equilibrium (RMC) and the critical nucleation concentration
(CNC), that is the threshold concentration of total subunits necessary for
initiating aggregation. When increasing the concentration of total subunits,
the RMC converges more strongly to its asymptotic value, the equilibrium
constant of depolymerization, for 3D aggregates and in case of nucleation. The
CNC moderately depends on the number of subunits in the nucleus, but sharply
increases with the difference between the equilibrium constants of
polymerization and nucleation. As the RMC and CNC can be numerically but not
analytically determined, ansatz equations connecting them to thermodynamic
parameters are proposed.

Formation of helical ion chains,"  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the linear to zigzag structural phase
transition exhibited by an ion chain confined in a trap with periodic boundary
conditions. The transition is driven by reducing the transverse confinement at
a finite quench rate, which can be accurately controlled. This results in the
formation of zigzag domains oriented along different transverse planes. The
twists between different domains can be stabilized by the topology of the trap
and under laser cooling the system has a chance to relax to a helical chain
with nonzero winding number. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to obtain
a large sample of possible trajectories for different quench rates. The scaling
of the average winding number with different quench rates is compared to the
prediction of the Kibble-Zurek theory, and a good quantitative agreement is
found.

Beyond Node Degree: Evaluating AS Topology Models,"  Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System (AS)
topologies, most of which make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In
this paper we compare AS topology generation models with several observed AS
topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid making assumptions
about which topological properties are important to characterize the AS
topology. Our analysis shows that, although matching degree-based properties,
the existing AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity of
the local interconnection structure between ASs. Furthermore, we use BGP data
from multiple vantage points to show that additional measurement locations
significantly affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node
centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by
additional measurements locations. These observations are particularly valid in
the core. The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an
underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the core caused by
inappropriate use of BGP data.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double-well (DW) potential with pair
tunneling by using a full quantum-mechanical treatment. Furthermore, we study
the quantum quench dynamics of the DW system subjected to a sudden change of
the Peierls phase. It is shown that strong pair tunneling evidently influences
the energy spectrum structure of the stationary states. For relatively weak
repulsive interatomic interactions, the dynamics of the DW system with a
maximal initial population difference evolves from Josephson oscillations to
quantum self-trapping as one increases the pair tunneling strength, while for
large repulsion the strong pair tunneling inhibits the quantum self-trapping.
In the case of attractive interatomic interactions, strong pair tunneling tends
to destroy the Josephson oscillations and quantum self-trapping, and the system
eventually enters a symmetric regime of zero population difference. Finally,
the effect of the Peierls phase on the quantum quench dynamics of the system is
analyzed and discussed. These new features are remarkably different from the
usual dynamical behaviors of a BEC in a DW potential.

"On the numerical treatment of dissipative particle dynamics and related
  systems","  We review and compare numerical methods that simultaneously control
temperature while preserving the momentum, a family of particle simulation
methods commonly used for the modelling of complex fluids and polymers. The
class of methods considered includes dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as
well as extended stochastic-dynamics models incorporating a generalized
pairwise thermostat scheme in which stochastic forces are eliminated and the
coefficient of dissipation is treated as an additional auxiliary variable
subject to a feedback (kinetic energy) control mechanism. In the latter case,
we consider the addition of a coupling of the auxiliary variable, as in the
Nos\'{e}-Hoover-Langevin (NHL) method, with stochastic dynamics to ensure
ergodicity, and find that the convergence of ensemble averages is substantially
improved. To this end, splitting methods are developed and studied in terms of
their thermodynamic accuracy, two-point correlation functions, and convergence.
In terms of computational efficiency as measured by the ratio of thermodynamic
accuracy to CPU time, we report significant advantages in simulation for the
pairwise NHL method compared to popular alternative schemes (up to an 80\%
improvement), without degradation of convergence rate. The momentum-conserving
thermostat technique described here provides a consistent hydrodynamic model in
the low-friction regime, but it will also be of use in both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium molecular simulation applications owing to its efficiency and
simple numerical implementation.
","On the numerical treatment of dissipative particle dynamics and related
  systems at the level of particle spin and electron-wave dynamics, the first two equations of Fe (Riemann-Basset) can be viewed as being equivalent, if not

"Ambient Backscatter Networking: A Novel Paradigm to Assist Wireless
  Powered Communications","  Ambient backscatter communication technology has been introduced recently,
and is then quickly becoming a promising choice for self-sustainable
communication systems as an external power supply or a dedicated carrier
emitter is not required. By leveraging existing RF signal resources, ambient
backscatter technology can support sustainable and independent communications
and consequently open up a whole new set of applications that facilitate
Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this article, we study an integration of ambient
backscatter with wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). We first
present an overview of backscatter communication systems with an emphasis on
the emerging ambient backscatter technology. Then we propose a novel hybrid
transmitter design by combining the advantages of both ambient backscatter and
wireless powered communications. Furthermore, in the cognitive radio
environment, we introduce a multiple access scheme to coordinate the hybrid
data transmissions. The performance evaluation shows that the hybrid
transmitter outperforms traditional designs. In addition, we discuss some open
issues related to the ambient backscatter networking.

"On Maximizing Energy and Data Delivery in Dense Wireless Local Area
  Networks","  Devices can now be powered wirelessly by Access Points (APs). However, an AP
cannot transmit frequently to charge devices as it may starve other nearby APs
operating on the same channel. Consequently, there is a need to schedule the
transmissions of APs to ensure their data queues remain short whilst charging
energy-harvesting devices. We present a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process
(MDP) to capture the queue states at APs and also channel conditions to nodes.
We then use the MDP to investigate the following transmission policies: max
weight, max queue, best channel state and random. Our results show that the max

energy.

four-) loop results for finite Lattice QCD renormalization constants. More
recently, a conceptual and technical framework has been devised to tame finite
size effects, which had been reported to be significant for (logarithmically)
divergent renormalization constants. In this work we present three-loop results
for fermion bilinears in the Lattice QCD regularization defined by tree-level
Symanzik improved gauge action and n_f=2 Wilson fermions. We discuss both
finite and divergent renormalization constants in the RI'-MOM scheme. Since
renormalization conditions are defined in the chiral limit, our results also
apply to Twisted Mass QCD, for which non-perturbative computations of the same
quantities are available. We emphasize the importance of carefully accounting
for both finite lattice space and finite volume effects. In our opinion the
latter have in general not attracted the attention they would deserve.

"Analysis of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Beam Profile Sensitivity for
  Neuromodulation of the Human Brain","  Objective. While ultrasound is largely established for use in diagnostic
imaging and heating therapies, its application for neuromodulation is
relatively new and not well understood. The objective of the present study was
to investigate issues related to interactions between focused acoustic beams
and brain tissues to better understand possible limitations of transcranial
ultrasound for neuromodulation. Approach. A computational model of transcranial
focused ultrasound was constructed and validated against bench top experimental
data. The models were then incrementally extended to address and investigate a
number of issues related to the use of ultrasound for neuromodulation. These
included the effect of variations in skull geometry and gyral anatomy, as well
as the effect of transmission across multiple tissue and media layers, such as
scalp, skull, CSF, and gray/white matter on ultrasound insertion behavior. In
addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to characterize the influence of
acoustic properties of intracranial tissues. Finally, the heating associated
with ultrasonic stimulation waveforms designed for neuromodulation was modeled.
Main results. Depending on factors such as acoustic frequency, the insertion
behavior of a transcranial focused ultrasound beam is only subtly influenced by
the geometry and acoustic properties of the underlying tissues. Significance.
These issues are critical for the refinement of device design and the overall
advancement of ultrasound methods for noninvasive neuromodulation.

Hyperbolic Graph Generator,"  Networks representing many complex systems in nature and society share some
common structural properties like heterogeneous degree distributions and strong
clustering. Recent research on network geometry has shown that those real
networks can be adequately modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic
spaces. In this paper, we present a computer program to generate such graphs.
Besides real-world-like networks, the program can generate random graphs from
other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model, random
geometric graphs on a circle, or Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. The
simulations show a good match between the expected values of different network

A Concurrent Global-local Numerical Method for Multiscale PDEs,"  We present a new hybrid numerical method for multiscale partial differential
equations, which simultaneously captures the global macroscopic information and
resolves the local microscopic events over regions of relatively small size.
The method couples concurrently the microscopic coefficients in the region of
interest with the homogenized coefficients elsewhere. The cost of the method is
comparable to the heterogeneous multiscale method, while being able to recover
microscopic information of the solution. The convergence of the method is
proved for problems with bounded and measurable coefficients, while the rate of
convergence is established for problems with rapidly oscillating periodic or
almost-periodic coefficients. Numerical results are reported to show the
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

"s-wave Superconductivity Phase Diagram in the Inhomogeneous
  Two-Dimensional Attractive Hubbard Model","  We study s-wave superconductivity in the two-dimensional square lattice
attractive Hubbard Hamiltonian for various inhomogeneous patterns of
interacting sites. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean field
approximation, we obtain the phase diagram for inhomogeneous patterns in which
the on-site attractive interaction U_i between the electrons takes on two
values, U_i=0 and -U/(1-f) (with f the concentration of non-interacting sites)
as a function of average electron occupation per site n, and study the
evolution of the phase diagram as f varies. In certain regions of the phase
diagram, inhomogeneity results in a larger zero temperature average pairing
amplitude (order parameter) and also a higher superconducting (SC) critical
temperature T_c, relative to a uniform system with the same mean interaction
strength (U_i=-U on all sites). These effects are observed for stripes,
checkerboard, and even random patterns of the attractive centers, suggesting
that the pattern of inhomogeneity is unimportant. The phase diagrams also
include regions where superconductivity is obliterated due to the formation of
various charge ordered phases. The enhancement of T_{c} due to inhomogeneity is
robust as long as the electron doping per site n is less than twice the
fraction of interacting sites [2(1-f)] regardless of the pattern. We also show
that for certain inhomogeneous patterns, when n = 2(1-f), increasing
temperature can work against the stability of existing charge ordered phases
for large f and as a result, enhance T_{c}.

Modelling of AC loss in coils made of thin tapes under DC bias current,"  Many applications, such as magnets and SMES, are usually charged and
discharged under a bias DC current, which may increase the AC loss. For their
design, it is necessary to understand and predict the AC loss. This article
analises the AC loss in magnet-like coils under DC bias contribution
super-imposed to the AC current. The analysis is based on a numerical model
that takes the interaction between magnetization currents in all turns into
account. The studied example is a stack of 32 pancake coils with 200 turns each
made of thin tape, such as $Re$BCO coated conductor. We present the current
density, the instantaneous power loss, and loss per cycle. We have found that
the loss increases with the DC bias current. The instantaneous power loss is
the largest in the initial rise of the the AC current. In following cycles, the
power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease. The loss per
cycle is the largest at the end pancakes. In conclusion, the highest cooling
power should be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current
rise, specially the initial one. The presented model has a high potential to
predict the AC loss in magnet-size coils, useful for their design.
","Modelling of AC loss in coils made of thin tapes under DC bias current is not known. For such evidence to be available at this level or in any form consistent with the present invention, it is necessary to prove that an electrical current carrying through AC currents by means of a negative terminal of voltage (a voltage that is sufficiently low as to cause the input signal to go into negative voltage) is present. An exemplary case of this kind is given by the way that the current through a resistor can be considered to pass through the wire or inductor as a voltage. It will be appreciated that this is a little more complicated than it sounds and will not be understood here. In actuality, the inductance at a terminal having a low conductance is known as the negative-diodes-current-voltage ratio. A low-conductance switch on a resistive circuit is sometimes defined as an AC voltage of the desired nominal value such that if the resistance is high, and any DC current in the circuit rises above the ideal",0.31054603834703115,0.26244343392641434,0.21974793076379906

Non-local transport via edge-states in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells,"  We have investigated low-temperature electronic transport on InAs/GaSb double
quantum wells, a system which promises to be electrically tunable from a normal

Business Rules in e-Government Applications,"  The introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into
public administrations has been radically changing the way organizations
cooperate and, more generally, the way to think about business processes over
organizational boundaries. In this paper we describe our approach to combining
business processes with business rules in order to integrate effectively single
units in an inter- or intra-organizational cooperation. Business rules
represent the knowledge that an administration has about its business; with
regard to this, they can express strategies, contracts and can influence not
only staff relations, but, finally, citizen relations, as well. In other words,
business rules are the core of an administration and affect either the business
processes or the behaviours of the system participants. They are typically
expressed implicitly in business contracts and they are embedded within the
source code of many application modules. So a concise and declarative statement
of business behaviour is converted into a set of programming instructions,
which are spread widely throughout the whole information system. In this way,
business rules are difficult to change and keep consistent over the time. For
this reason, it is necessary to reengineer the system in order to logically and
perhaps physically externalize rules from the application code. In our proposed
approach, we describe a cooperation as a collection of tasks combined in
certain ways according to the organization logic specified by business rules.
Our rule-driven methodology has the goal to make the business process design
more adaptable to the changes of internal or external environment.
","Business Rules in e-Government Applications?

This is the most interesting story of all: In the last four years of the eHealth program, the state has received a growing number of applications from states and the private sector to make the Affordable Care Act (ACA) an essential part of their policies. For every one of these states, there has been another applicant that has a very similar problem, and that needs to be fixed. So what's the solution? What should we think about these applications? If we put in a law that makes it a priority to include a program like Medicare or Medicaid in an eGovernment application, will it succeed or fail?

Spin Precession Experiments for Light Axionic Dark Matter,"  Axion-like particles are promising candidates to make up the dark matter of
the universe, but it is challenging to design experiments that can detect them
over their entire allowed mass range. Dark matter in general, and in particular
axion-like particles and hidden photons, can be as light as roughly $10^{-22}
\;\rm{eV}$ ($\sim 10^{-8} \;\rm{Hz}$), with astrophysical anomalies providing
motivation for the lightest masses (""fuzzy dark matter""). We propose
experimental techniques for direct detection of axion-like dark matter in the
mass range from roughly $10^{-13} \;\rm{eV}$ ($\sim 10^2 \;\rm{Hz}$) down to
the lowest possible masses. In this range, these axion-like particles act as a
time-oscillating magnetic field coupling only to spin, inducing effects such as
a time-oscillating torque and periodic variations in the spin-precession
frequency with the frequency and direction set by fundamental physics. We show
how these signals can be measured using existing experimental technology,
including torsion pendulums, atomic magnetometers, and atom interferometry.
These experiments demonstrate a strong discovery capability, with future
iterations of these experiments capable of pushing several orders of magnitude
past current astrophysical bounds.
","Spin Precession Experiments for Light Axionic Dark Matter

The National Science Foundation, of course, has some very good, fun science experiments that they use. A lot of which involve light or dark matter. The good news is that, while the research is very useful and the results promising, they have limitations. Many of the experiments are done with a very low probability that the light photons from that experiment will be enough to cause the observed decay and to stabilize the atomic structure. These experiments use extremely high-energy neutrinos. One must remember that these positrons are not free electrons. I hope that we can continue to use these materials for these experiments and more.

"Worst-case Throughput Analysis for Parametric Rate and Parametric Actor
  Execution Time Scenario-Aware Dataflow Graphs","  Scenario-aware dataflow (SADF) is a prominent tool for modeling and analysis
of dynamic embedded dataflow applications. In SADF the application is
represented as a finite collection of synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs, each
of which represents one possible application behaviour or scenario. A finite
state machine (FSM) specifies the possible orders of scenario occurrences. The
SADF model renders the tightest possible performance guarantees, but is limited
by its finiteness. This means that from a practical point of view, it can only
handle dynamic dataflow applications that are characterized by a reasonably
sized set of possible behaviours or scenarios. In this paper we remove this
limitation for a class of SADF graphs by means of SADF model parametrization in
terms of graph port rates and actor execution times. First, we formally define
the semantics of the model relevant for throughput analysis based on (max,+)
linear system theory and (max,+) automata. Second, by generalizing some of the
existing results, we give the algorithms for worst-case throughput analysis of
parametric rate and parametric actor execution time acyclic SADF graphs with a
fully connected, possibly infinite state transition system. Third, we
demonstrate our approach on a few realistic applications from digital signal
processing (DSP) domain mapped onto an embedded multi-processor architecture.

You might have seen my prediction of a variable being the first data point (in that order). After reading this article as a part of my tutorial on Cross-Applicative Modeling, I knew it would be a worthwhile idea of mine to do a very small amount of work to generate an open source cross validation model that was more appropriate for an actual real world situation in which you could do the same work.

"Quantum frequency conversion to telecom of single photons from a
  nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond","  We report on the conversion to telecom wavelength of single photons emitted
by a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. By means of difference frequency
generation, we convert spin-selective photons at 637 nm, associated with the
coherent NV zero-phonon-line, to the target wavelength of 1588 nm in the
L-telecom band. The successful conversion is evidenced by time-resolved
detection revealing a telecom photon lifetime identical to that of the original
637 nm photon. Furthermore, we show by second-order correlation measurements
that the single-photon statistics are preserved. The overall efficiency of this
one-step conversion reaches 17\% in our current setup, along with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx$7 despite the low probability $(< 10^{-3})$
of an incident 637 nm photon. This result shows the potential for efficient
telecom photon - NV center interfaces and marks an important step towards
future long-range entanglement-based quantum networks.

"The Kepler Dichotomy in Planetary Disks: Linking Kepler Observables to
  Simulations of Late-Stage Planet Formation","  NASA's Kepler Mission uncovered a wealth of planetary systems, many with
planets on short-period orbits. These short-period systems reside around 50% of
Sun-like stars and are similarly prevalent around M dwarfs. Their formation and
subsequent evolution is the subject of active debate. In this paper, we
simulate late-stage, in-situ planet formation across a grid of planetesimal
disks with varying surface density profiles and total mass. We compare
simulation results with observable characteristics of the Kepler sample. We
identify mixture models with different primordial planetesimal disk properties
that self-consistently recover the multiplicity, period ratio and duration
ratio distributions of the Kepler planets. We draw three main conclusions: (1)
We favor a ""frozen-in"" narrative for systems of short period planets, in which
they are stable over long timescales, as opposed to metastable. (2) The ""Kepler
dichotomy"", an observed phenomenon of the Kepler sample wherein the
architectures of planetary systems appear to either vary significantly or have
multiple modes, can naturally be explained by formation within planetesimal
disks with varying surface density profiles. Finally, (3) we quantify the
nature of the ""Kepler dichotomy"" for both GK stars and M dwarfs, and find that
it varies with stellar type. While the mode of planet formation that accounts
for highly multiplistic systems occurs in 24+/-7% of planetary systems orbiting
GK stars, it occurs in 63+/-16% of planetary systems orbiting M dwarfs.

Supernovae as cosmological probes,"  The cosmological standard model at present is widely accepted as containing
mainly things we do not understand. In particular the appearance of a
Cosmological Constant, or dark energy, is puzzling. This was first inferred
from the Hubble diagram of a low number of Type Ia supernovae, and later
corroborated by complementary cosmological probes. Today, a much larger
collection of supernovae is available, and here I perform a rigorous
statistical analysis of this dataset. Taking into account how the supernovae
are calibrated to be standard candles, we run into some subtleties in the
analysis. To our surprise, this new dataset - about an order of bigger than the
size of the original dataset - shows, under standard assumptions, only mild
evidence of an accelerated universe.

Cell-Free and User-Centric Massive MIMO at Millimeter Wave Frequencies,"  In a cell-free (CF) massive MIMO architecture a very large number of
distributed access points (APs) simultaneously and jointly serves a much

is the user-centric (UC) approach, wherein each AP just decodes a reduced set
of MSs, practically the ones that are received best. This paper introduces and
analyzes the CF and UC architectures at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies.
First of all, a multiuser clustered channel model is introduced in order to
account for the correlation among the channels of nearby users; then, an uplink
multiuser channel estimation scheme is described along with low-complexity
hybrid analog/digital beamforming architectures. Interestingly, in the proposed
scheme no channel estimation is needed at the MSs, and the beamforming schemes
used at the MSs are channel-independent and have a very simple structure.
Numerical results show that the considered architectures provide good
performance, especially in lightly loaded systems, with the UC approach
outperforming the CF one.

Ergodic vs diffusive decoherence in mesoscopic devices,"  We report on the measurement of phase coherence length in a high mobility
two-dimensional electron gas patterned in two different geometries, a wire and
a ring. The phase coherence length is extracted both from the weak localization
correction in long wires and from the amplitude of the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations in a single ring, in a low temperature regime when decoherence is
dominated by electronic interactions. We show that these two measurements lead
to different phase coherence lengths, namely $L_{\Phi}^\mathrm{wire}\propto
T^{-1/3}$ and $L_{\Phi}^\mathrm{ring}\propto T^{-1/2}$. This difference
reflects the fact that the electrons winding around the ring necessarily
explore the whole sample (ergodic trajectories), while in a long wire the
electrons lose their phase coherence before reaching the edges of the sample
(diffusive regime).

"Collective behavior of quorum-sensing run-and-tumble particles in
  confinement","  We study a generic model for quorum-sensing bacteria in circular confinement.
Every bacterium produces signaling molecules, the local concentration of which
triggers a response when a certain threshold is reached. If this response
lowers the motility then an aggregation of bacteria occurs, which differs
fundamentally from standard motility-induced phase separation due to the
long-ranged nature of the concentration of signal molecules. We analyze this
phenomenon analytically and by numerical simulations employing two different
protocols leading to stationary cluster and ring morphologies, respectively.

The Relation Between Classical and Quantum Mechanics,"  Familiar formulations of classical and quantum mechanics are shown to follow
from a general theory of mechanics based on pure states with an intrinsic
probability structure. This theory is developed to the stage where theorems
from quantum logic enable expression of the state geometry in Hilbert space.
Quantum and classical mechanics are then elaborated and applied to subsystems
and the measurement process. Consideration is also given to space-time geometry
and the constraints this places on the dynamics. Physics and Mathematics, it is
argued, are growing apart; the inadequate treatment of approximations in
general and localisation in quantum mechanics in particular are seen as
contributing factors. In the description of systems, the link between
localisation and lack of knowledge shows that quantum mechanics should reflect
the domain of applicability. Restricting the class of states provides a means
of achieving this goal. Localisation is then shown to have a mathematical
expression in terms of compactness, which in turn is applied to yield a
topological theory of bound and scattering states. Finally, the thesis
questions the validity of classical limits and quantisations in intertheoretic
reduction, and demonstrates that a widely accepted classical limit does not
constitute a proof of reduction. It proposes a procedure for determining
whether classical and quantum mechanics are weakly equivalent over a domain of
applicability, and concludes that, in this restricted sense, classical
mechanics reduces to quantum mechanics.
","The Relation Between Classical and Quantum Mechanics is very relevant since the relationship between any of these two methods is clearly an important one. We will see how the ""two ways of explaining things"" idea was developed during the early 1970s in an article written by Professor Eberle in 1996. On the other hand, it appears that Professor David Kropotkin in his book on quantum theory and quantum mechanics, and also in the book ""The Metaphysical Science of Quantum Physics and Its Interpretation"" is the author of a complete list of major works written over a number of decades by the famous physicist E. T. Hawking, one of the few physicists who accepted the existence of classical mechanics without a serious doubt. In this book he also gives a great overview of quantum physics, making it clearly evident why this was done by using the theory of constant motion and of invariance and that to explain all quantum forces we need to consider some other means.

Self Adversarial Training for Human Pose Estimation,"  This paper presents a deep learning based approach to the problem of human
pose estimation. We employ generative adversarial networks as our learning
paradigm in which we set up two stacked hourglass networks with the same
architecture, one as the generator and the other as the discriminator. The
generator is used as a human pose estimator after the training is done. The
discriminator distinguishes ground-truth heatmaps from generated ones, and
back-propagates the adversarial loss to the generator. This process enables the
generator to learn plausible human body configurations and is shown to be
useful for improving the prediction accuracy.

"Household poverty classification in data-scarce environments: a machine
  learning approach","  We describe a method to identify poor households in data-scarce countries by
leveraging information contained in nationally representative household
surveys. It employs standard statistical learning techniques---cross-validation
and parameter regularization---which together reduce the extent to which the
model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey data. The
automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development
setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the
costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed
to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after
data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the
model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that
may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data
from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households
from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.

  Relay Channel - Part I: Sequential Decode-and-Forward (SDF)","  In this two part paper we consider a wireless network in which a source
terminal communicates with a destination and a relay terminal is occasionally
present in close proximity to the source without source's knowledge, suggesting
oblivious protocols. The source-relay channel is assumed to be a fixed gain
AWGN due to the proximity while the source-destination and the
relay-destination channels are subject to a block flat Rayleigh fading. A
perfect CSI at the respective receivers only is assumed. With the average
throughput as a performance measure, we incorporate a two-layer broadcast
approach into two cooperative strategies based on the decode-and-forward scheme

part II. The broadcast approach splits the transmitted rate into superimposed
layers corresponding to a ""bad"" and a ""good"" channel states, allowing better
adaptation to the actual channel conditions In part I, the achievable rate
expressions for the SDF strategy are derived under the broadcast approach for
multiple settings including single user, MISO and the general relay setting

"The Effect of Jupiter's Formation on the Distribution of Refractory

disk, constructed to resolve the ""CAI Storage"" problem of meteoritics. We
predict the abundances of calcium-rich, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and
refractory lithophile elements under the central assumption that Jupiter's
$\sim 30 \, M_{\oplus}$ core forms at about 3 AU at around 0.6 Myr and opened a
gap CAIs are trapped in the pressure maximum beyond Jupiter; carbonaceous
chondrites formed there. Inside Jupiter's orbit, CAIs were depleted by
aerodynamic drag; ordinary and enstatite chondrites formed there. For 16
chondrites and achondrites, we review meteoritic data on their CAI and
refractory abundances and their times of formation, constrained by radiometric
dating and thermal models. We predict their formation locations, finding
excellent consistency with other location information (water content, asteroid
spectra and parent bodies). We predict the size of particle concentrated by
turbulence for each chondrite, finding excellent matches to each chondrites's
mean chondrule diameter. These consistencies imply meteorite parent bodies
assembled quickly from local materials concentrated by turbulence, and usually
did not migrate far. We predict CI chondrites are depleted in refractory
lithophile elements relative to the Sun, by about 12% (0.06 dex). We constrain
the variation of turbulence parameter $\alpha$ in the disk, and find a limited
role for magnetorotational instability, favoring hydrodynamical instabilities
in the outer disk, plus magnetic disk winds in the inner disk. Between 3 and 4
Myr at least, gas persisted outside Jupiter but was depleted inside it, and the
solar nebula was a transition disk.
","The Effect of Jupiter's Formation on the Distribution of Refractory

In addition, some meteorites produce a spectrum of their element, known as the isotopic form (C–B). For example, the formation of meteors from the sun, for example Uranus (1701a and 1701b), consists of three groups of highly reactive elements: K, M, and P.
, P, K and M are all isotopes found in meteorite (e.g., KJ18-T7). P is a complex element that forms in reaction with KH and a few other elements. P and K contain a large fraction of all elements (9, 10, 13, 14). Thus, their formation is not always marked with small amounts of p. The presence of M is the reason that we can call it a C–K phase. It has one of the smallest C-K phases in Earth's meteorological history. This phase occurs around 1848. In Earth, it is called the C′-G phase (14).

Arithmetic of 0-cycles on varieties defined over number fields,"  Let $X$ be a rationally connected algebraic variety, defined over a number
field $k$. We find a relation between the arithmetic of rational points on $X$
and the arithmetic of zero-cycles. More precisely, we consider the following
statements: (1) the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to weak
approximation for $K$-rational points on $X_K$ for all finite extensions $K/k$;
(2) the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to weak approximation
in some sense that we define for zero-cycles of degree 1 on $X_K$ for all
finite extensions $K/k$; (3) a certain sequence of local-global type for Chow
groups of 0-cycles on $X_K$ is exact for all finite extensions $K/k$. We prove
that (1) implies (2), and that (2) and (3) are equivalent. We also prove a
similar implication for the Hasse principle.

Homologous Control of Protein Signaling Networks,"  In a previous paper we introduced a method called augmented sparse
reconstruction (ASR) that identifies links among nodes of ordinary differential
equation networks, given a small set of observed trajectories with various
initial conditions. The main purpose of that technique was to reconstruct
intracellular protein signaling networks. In this paper we show that a
recursive augmented sparse reconstruction generates artificial networks that
are homologous to a large, reference network, in the sense that kinase
inhibition of several reactions in the network alters the trajectories of a
sizable number of proteins in comparable ways for reference and reconstructed
networks. We show this result using a large in-silico model of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGF-R) driven signaling cascade to generate the data
used in the reconstruction algorithm. The most significant consequence of this
observed homology is that a nearly optimal combinatorial dosage of kinase
inhibitors can be inferred, for many nodes, from the reconstructed network, a
result potentially useful for a variety of applications in personalized
medicine.

Searching for luminous absorbed sources in the WISE AGN catalogue,"  Mid-IR colour selection techniques have proved to be very efficient in
finding AGN. This is because the AGN heats the surrounding dust producing warm
mid-IR colours. Using the WISE 3.6, 4.5 and 12 $\mu m$ colours, the largest
sample of IR selected AGN has already been produced containing 1.4 million AGN
over the whole sky. Here, we explore the X-ray properties of this AGN sample by
cross-correlating it with the subsample of the 3XMM X-ray catalogue that has
available X-ray spectra and at the same time optical spectroscopy from SDSS.
Our goal is to find rare luminous obscured AGN. Our final sample contains 65
QSOs with $\rm{log}\,\nu L_\nu \ge 46.2$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. This IR luminosity cut
corresponds to $\rm{log}\,L_X \approx 45$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, at the median
redshift of our sample ($z=2.3$), that lies at the bright end of the X-ray
luminosity function at $z>2$. The X-ray spectroscopic analysis reveals seven
obscured AGN having a column density $\rm N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}$. Six of them
show evidence for broad [CIV] absorption lines and five are classified as
BALQSOs. We fit the optical spectra of our X-ray absorbed sources to estimate
the optical reddening. We find that none of these show any obscuration
according to the optical continuum. These sources add to the growing evidence
for populations of luminous QSOs with evidence for substantial absorption by
outflowing ionised material, similar to those expected to be emerging from
their absorbing cocoons in the framework of AGN/galaxy co-evolution.
","Searching for luminous absorbed sources in the WISE AGN catalogue [1]. A relatively poor list of available sources exists and it seems an unavailability may be a contributing factor. One possible explanation for this seems to be that WIST will become increasingly difficult to detect and the detection of objects in low frequencies and therefore requires additional photoperiod.

modernize legacy code by re-engineering and rewriting it in terms of highly
optimized libraries. We illustrate how this initial effort to get efficient and
portable shared-memory code enables fast porting of the code to emerging
heterogeneous architectures. More specifically, we port the code to nodes
equipped with multiple GPUs. We divide our study in two parts. First, we show
considerable speedups attained by minor and relatively straightforward code
changes to off-load parts of the computation to the GPUs. Then, we identify
further possible improvements to achieve even higher performance and
scalability. On a system consisting of 16-cores and 2 GPUs, we observe speedups
of up to 5x with respect to our optimized shared-memory code, which in turn

"On the binary nature of massive blue hypergiants: high-resolution X-ray
  spectroscopy suggests that Cyg OB2 12 is a colliding wind binary","  The blue hypergiant Cyg OB2-12 (B3Ia+) is a representative member of the
class of very massive stars in a poorly understood evolutionary stage. We
obtained its high-resolution X-ray spectrum using Chandra observatory. PoWR
model atmospheres were calculated to provide realistic wind opacities and to
establish the wind density structure. We find that collisional de-excitation is
the dominant mechanism de-populating the metastable upper levels of the
forbidden lines of the He-like ions SiXIV and MgXII. Comparison between the
model and observations reveals that X-ray emission is produced in a dense
plasma, which could reside only at the photosphere or in a colliding wind zone
between binary components. The observed X-ray spectra are well fitted by
thermal plasma models, with average temperatures in excess of 10 MK. The wind
speed in Cyg OB2-12 is not high enough to power such high temperatures, but the
collision of two winds in a binary system can be sufficient. We used archival
data to investigate the X-ray properties of other blue hypergiants. In general,
stars of this class are not detected as X-rays sources. We suggest that our new
Chandra observations of Cyg OB2-12 can be best explained if Cyg OB2-12 is a
colliding wind binary possessing a late O-type companion. This makes Cyg OB2-12
only the second binary system among the 16 known Galactic hypergiants. This low
binary fraction indicates that the blue hypergiants are likely products of
massive binary evolution during which they either accreted a significant amount
of mass or already merged with their companion.
","On the binary nature of massive blue hypergiants: high-resolution X-ray
  spectroscopy suggests that Cyg OB2 12 is a colliding wind binary with an outer side that may or may not be formed from an orbit of a black hole. It indicates the origin of an inner galaxy in the middle of the inner-matter galaxy. Such a merger is possible because the dust-containing stars contain extremely large amounts of ""star dust"", as described by the International Astronomical Union in 1976. This will increase the velocity of cosmic rays due to their increased density and thus accelerate their spin and hence mass. Therefore it is suggested that the stellar dust may be in contact with the sub-atomic particles of one side's core.

domain to frequency domain. Firstly a gray level image of size M x N is divided
into no joint 8 x 8 blocks and a two dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2-d
DCT) is performed on each of the P = MN / 64 blocks. Then Huffman encoding is
also performed on the secret messages/images before embedding and each bit of
Huffman code of secret message/image is embedded in the frequency domain by
altering the least significant bit of each of the DCT coefficients of cover
image blocks. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high
capacity and a good invisibility. Moreover PSNR of cover image with stego-image
shows the better results in comparison with other existing steganography

"Measurements and analysis of current-voltage characteristic of a pn
  diode for an undergraduate physics laboratory","  We show that in a simple experiment at undergraduate level, suitable to be
performed in classes of science and engineering students, it is possible to
test accurately, on a popular 1N4148 p-n diode, the range of the junction
currents where the Shockley equation model can be considered satisfactory. The
experiment benefits from a system of temperature control and data collection
driven in a LabVIEW environment. With these tools a large quantity of data can
be recorded in the temporal frame of a lab session. Significant deviations of
the experimental I-V with respect to the ideal behaviour curve predicted by the
Shockley equation are observed, both at low and high current. A better
agreement over the entire range is obtained introducing, as is customary, a
four parameters model, including a parallel and a series resistance. A new
iterative fitting procedure is presented which treats the I-V data of different
regimes on the same level, and allows a simultaneous determination of the four
parameters for each temperature selected. Moreover, the knowledge of the
temperature dependence of saturation current is used to estimate the energy gap

"Thermally activated switching of perpendicular magnet by spin-orbit spin
  torque","  We theoretically investigate the threshold current for thermally activated
switching of a perpendicular magnet by spin-orbit spin torque. Based on the
Fokker-Planck equation, we obtain an analytic expression of the switching
current, in agreement with numerical result. We find that thermal energy
barrier exhibits a quasi-linear dependence on the current, resulting in an
almost linear dependence of switching current on the log-scaled current
pulse-width even below 10 ns. This is in stark contrast to standard spin torque
switching, where thermal energy barrier has a quadratic dependence on the
current and the switching current rapidly increases at short pulses. Our
results will serve as a guideline to design and interpret switching experiments

Supervised Dimensionality Reduction for Big Data,"  To solve key biomedical problems, experimentalists now routinely measure
millions or billions of features (dimensions) per sample, with the hope that
data science techniques will be able to build accurate data-driven inferences.
Because sample sizes are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the
dimensionality of these data, valid inferences require finding a
low-dimensional representation that preserves the discriminating information
(e.g., whether the individual suffers from a particular disease). There is a
lack of interpretable supervised dimensionality reduction methods that scale to
millions of dimensions with strong statistical theoretical guarantees.We
introduce an approach, XOX, to extending principal components analysis by
incorporating class-conditional moment estimates into the low-dimensional
projection. The simplest ver-sion, ""Linear Optimal Low-rank"" projection (LOL),
incorporates the class-conditional means. We prove, and substantiate with both
synthetic and real data benchmarks, that LOL and its generalizations in the XOX
framework lead to improved data representations for subsequent classification,
while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. Using multiple
brain imaging datasets consisting of >150 million features, and several
genomics datasets with>500,000 features, LOL outperforms other scalable linear
dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of accuracy, while only requiring
a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.

Determining Optimal Trading Rules without Backtesting,"  Calibrating a trading rule using a historical simulation (also called
backtest) contributes to backtest overfitting, which in turn leads to
underperformance. In this paper we propose a procedure for determining the
optimal trading rule (OTR) without running alternative model configurations
through a backtest engine. We present empirical evidence of the existence of
such optimal solutions for the case of prices following a discrete
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show how they can be computed numerically.
Although we do not derive a closed-form solution for the calculation of OTRs,
we conjecture its existence on the basis of the empirical evidence presented.

  Ensembles","  Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are a highly promising
platform for high-sensitivity magnetometry, whose efficacy is often based on

approximately 3 nT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with further enhancement limited by the
noise floor of the lock-in amplifier and the laser damage threshold of the

Oceanic rings and jets as statistical equilibrium states,"  Equilibrium statistical mechanics of two-dimensional flows provides an
explanation and a prediction for the self-organization of large scale coherent
structures. This theory is applied in this paper to the description of oceanic
rings and jets, in the framework of a 1.5 layer quasi-geostrophic model. The
theory predicts the spontaneous formation of regions where the potential
vorticity is homogenized, with strong and localized jets at their interface.
Mesoscale rings are shown to be close to a statistical equilibrium: the theory
accounts for their shape, their drift, and their ubiquity in the ocean,
independently of the underlying generation mechanism. At basin scale, inertial
states presenting mid basin eastward jets (and then different from the
classical Fofonoff solution) are described as marginally unstable states. These
states are shown to be marginally unstable for the equilibrium statistical
theory. In that case, considering a purely inertial limit is a first step
toward more comprehensive out of equilibrium studies that would take into
account other essential aspects, such as wind forcing.
","Oceanic rings and jets as statistical equilibrium states [10, 16]. The existence of highly polar regions in the ring centers will lead to a higher density over larger geographic areas.

3D view of transient horizontal magnetic fields in the photosphere,"  We infer the 3D magnetic structure of a transient horizontal magnetic field
(THMF) during its evolution through the photosphere using SIRGAUS inversion
code. The SIRGAUS code is a modified version of SIR (Stokes Inversion based on
Response function), and allows for retrieval of information on the magnetic and
thermodynamic parameters of the flux tube embedded in the atmosphere from the
observed Stokes profiles. Spectro-polarimetric observations of the quiet Sun at
the disk center were performed with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board
Hinode with Fe I 630.2 nm lines. Using repetitive scans with a cadence of 130
s, we first detect the horizontal field that appears inside a granule, near its
edge. On the second scan, vertical fields with positive and negative polarities
appear at both ends of the horizontal field. Then, the horizontal field
disappears leaving the bipolar vertical magnetic fields. The results from the
inversion of the Stokes spectra clearly point to the existence of a flux tube
with magnetic field strength of $\sim400$ G rising through the line forming
layer of the Fe I 630.2 nm lines. The flux tube is located at around
$\log\tau_{500} \sim0$ at $\Delta t$=0 s and around $\log\tau_{500} \sim-1.7$
at $\Delta t$=130 s. At $\Delta t$=260 s the horizontal part is already above
the line forming region of the analyzed lines. The observed Doppler velocity is
maximally 3 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the upward motion of the structure as
retrieved from the SIRGAUS code. The vertical size of the tube is smaller than
the thickness of the line forming layer. The THMF has a clear
$\Omega$-shaped-loop structure with the apex located near the edge of a
granular cell. The magnetic flux carried by this THMF is estimated to be
$3.1\times10^{17}$ Mx.
","3D view of transient horizontal magnetic fields in the photosphere. Credit: S.M.P. Deveau et al., RTSR International (Phys.org)—We've known for a while that the magnetic field is being drawn outward on the surface of a deep blue sky. We knew there was some magnetic flux and some particles within the plasma that were attracted to that flux—just as we know these electromagnetic fields cause magnetic jets in a given region of the sky and this magnetic force then attracts the particles towards the area where the jet will be. Our simulations show a clear sign of this.

This is the best evidence yet showing that these fields have the potential to cause the Sun's magnetic landscape, and the presence of these field-like magnetism in its most dense spots for example on deep, deep-sea and deep solar systems, can affect the environment on Earth and on our space missions. To see how this could actually happen, we looked at hundreds of thousands of observations made to date. This team used a series of simulations that use a high-quality model of gravity that can predict the shape, velocity, size and direction of magnetic forces all by herself. The results clearly show that both the current and future magnetic environment of Earth can contribute to the formation of significant magnetospheric layers and that this happens largely by interacting with the field.

"Qualitative Insight and Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of
  Temperature on the Coercivity of a Magnetic System","  The temperature dependence of the response of a magnetic system to an applied
field can be understood qualitatively by considering variations in the energy
surface characterizing the system and estimated quantitatively with rate
theory. In the system analysed here, Fe/Sm-Co spring magnet, the width of the
hysteresis loop is reduced to a half when temperature is raised from 25~K to
300~K. This narrowing can be explained and reproduced quantitatively without
invoking temperature dependence of model parameters as has typically been done
in previous data analysis. The applied magnetic field lowers the energy barrier
for reorientation of the magnetization but thermal activation brings the system
over the barrier. A 2-dimensional representation of the energy surface is
developed and used to gain insight into the transition mechanism and to
demonstrate how the applied field alters the transition path. Our results show
the importance of explicitly including the effect of thermal activation when
interpreting experiments involving the manipulation of magnetic systems at
finite temperature.

New ways to search for right-handed current in B -> rho ell nu decay,"  An interesting possibility to ease the tension between various determinations
of |V_{ub}| is to allow a small right-handed contribution to the standard model

propose new ways to search for such a beyond standard model contribution in
semileptonic B -> rho ell nu decay. Generalized asymmetries in one, two, or
three angular variables are introduced as discriminators, which do not require
an unbinned analysis of the fully differential distribution, and a detailed

on how binned measurements can access all the angular information follows,
which may be useful in both B -> rho ell nu and B -> K^* ell^+ ell^-, and

Worst-Case Load Shedding in Electric Power Networks,"  We consider the worst-case load-shedding problem in electric power networks
where a number of transmission lines are to be taken out of service. The
objective is to identify a pre-specified number of line outage that leads to
the maximum interruption of power generation and load at the transmission
level, subject to the AC power flow model, the load and generation capacity of
the buses, and the phase angle limit across the transmission lines. For this
nonlinear model with binary constraints, we show that all decision variables
are separable except for the nonlinear power flow equations. We develop an
iterative decomposition algorithm, which converts the worst-case load shedding
problem into a sequence of small subproblems. We show that the subproblems are
either convex problems that can be solved efficiently or nonconvex problems
that have closed-form solutions. Consequently, our approach is scalable for
large networks. Furthermore, we prove global convergence of our algorithm to a
critical point and the objective value is guaranteed to decrease throughout the
iterations. Numerical experiments with IEEE test cases demonstrate the
effectiveness of the developed approach.
","Worst-Case Load Shedding in Electric Power Networks

To use a typical household, all of the things you need to know are in order:
- The electrical wiring that it will use.
. - The number of hours the current will be drawn. This is important to understand if it is possible for this to take place. The current draw of a conventional power source does not give out the number (or other meaningful numbers), so this would have to be done right. However, even if the draw is zero, if your current does keep rising, it would mean your home cannot be generating enough electricity for the entire year. And then the household would be out of electricity. At that point, the electricity would cease to operate. It's more important you understand this. (The more you know of this, you will start to see it in your own home.)

main idea was that characteristic maps on $K$ theoretically determine all
possible characteristic maps on a wedge of $K$.
  In this work, we further develop our previous work for classification of
toric spaces. For a star-shaped simplicial sphere $K$ of dimension $n-1$ with
$m$ vertices, the Picard number $\operatorname{Pic}(K)$ of $K$ is $m-n$. We
refer to $K$ a seed if $K$ cannot be obtained by wedgings. First, we show that,
for a fixed positive integer $\ell$, there are at most finitely many seeds of
Picard number $\ell$ supporting characteristic maps. As a corollary, the
conjecture proposed by V. V. Batyrev in 1991 is solved affirmatively.
  Second, we investigate a systematic way to find all characteristic maps on
$K(J)$ using combinatorial objects called (realizable) puzzles that only depend
on a seed $K$. These two facts lead to a practical way to classify the toric
spaces of fixed Picard number.

The problem for the two architectures, of course, is that the kernel and kernel-specific bits in each is of special importance to different people or systems. For example, the '0' in R.C.E.A.U. is not a physical 'value' to 'bits' (though it has a special capacity for non-routing and/or nonlocal values). The '9' or '11' on the Linux kernel is a 'type' that is special to the user. The kernel has its own type of the type 'hw'. As well, that type isn't used by the sysfs and by some other system components unless specifically mentioned. By default it also behaves in the sense of a nonlinear number. However, '1' may be used to point at a particular type in a data stream, and that could be useful for some applications (the only important use is making a logarithmic log to",0.19981249205993346,0.17040358251724358,0.13954329217398465

obtain central charges of the two dimensional dual CFT. To obtain the central
charges, we use the relation between entropy and temperature according to the

Can one extract energy loss probability distributions from R_AA?,"  The nuclear suppression of high transverse momentum P_T hadrons is one of the
most striking findings in heavy-ion collision experiments. It has long been
recognized that the suppression can be theoretically described by folding the
primary parton spectrum with an energy loss probability distribution which is
suitably averaged over the collision geometry. However, an interesting problem
is to what degree the procedure can be inverted, i.e. given a measurement of
the suppression factor R_AA with arbitrary precision, can the probability
distribution of energy loss be extracted in a model-independent way? In this
note, we present a conceptual study of the inversion problem for LHC energies
and demonstrate that a measurement of R_AA alone is insufficient to determine
the distribution, other observables such as gamma-hadron correlations must be
taken into account.
","Can one extract energy loss probability distributions from R_AA?

The R version of this function is shown in Figure 2. The posterior probability estimate from this model is 0.95%.
 [1] The model for the current model shows that for a given parameter the average energy gain can be reduced by increasing the β-sheet over the parameter's period of uncertainty. That is, the number of points over a specified period should be small. This does not mean there is no future energy benefit (due to the fact that the model still has a period at very low error). The energy gains can therefore be extended to other parameters and still return",0.3107624512825673,0.19999999504429078,0.21673057197420112
"Gaps in the HD169142 protoplanetary disk revealed by polarimetric
  imaging: Signs of ongoing planet formation?","  We present H-band VLT/NACO polarized light images of the Herbig Ae/Be star
HD169142 probing its protoplanetary disk as close as ~0.1"" to the star. Our
images trace the face-on disk out to ~1.7"" (~250 AU) and reveal distinct
sub-structures for the first time: 1) the inner disk (<20 AU) appears to be
depleted in scattering dust grains; 2) an unresolved disk rim is imaged at ~25
AU; 3) an annular gap extends from ~40 - 70 AU; 4) local brightness asymmetries
are found on opposite sides of the annular gap. We discuss different
explanations for the observed morphology among which ongoing planet formation
is a tempting - but yet to be proven - one. Outside of ~85 AU the surface
brightness drops off roughly r^{-3.3}, but describing the disk regions between
85-120 AU / 120-250 AU separately with power-laws r^{-2.6} / r^{-3.9} provides
a better fit hinting towards another discontinuity in the disk surface. The
flux ratio between the disk integrated polarized light and the central star is
~4.1 * 10^{-3}. Finally, combining our results with those from the literature,
~40% of the scattered light in the H-band appears to be polarized. Our results
emphasize that HD169142 is an interesting system for future planet formation or
disk evolution studies.

Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy by stepwise optical saturation,"  Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is an important tool in biomedical
research for its ability to discern features smaller than the diffraction
limit. However, due to its difficult implementation and high cost, the
universal application of super-resolution microscopy is not feasible. In this
paper, we propose and demonstrate a new kind of super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy that can be easily implemented and requires neither additional
hardware nor complex post-processing. The microscopy is based on the principle
of stepwise optical saturation (SOS), where $M$ steps of raw fluorescence
images are linearly combined to generate an image with a $\sqrt{M}$-fold
increase in resolution compared with conventional diffraction-limited images.
For example, linearly combining (scaling and subtracting) two images obtained
at regular powers extends resolution by a factor of $1.4$ beyond the
diffraction limit. The resolution improvement in SOS microscopy is
theoretically infinite but practically is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio.
We perform simulations and experimentally demonstrate super-resolution
microscopy with both one-photon (confocal) and multiphoton excitation
fluorescence. We show that with the multiphoton modality, the SOS microscopy
can provide super-resolution imaging deep in scattering samples.

We used 2 million laser beams to measure the fluence at 8 μm. The first image was taken before the start of the experiments. We obtained fluences measured at 300 μM in four different spectral combinations. Only three fluisomes appeared to be visible from the dark and in many of sublimated samples. This showed that the blue flu (PX-E-8) fluorite has not evolved with size. A similar pattern had also emerged in the other two fluides, K and K+, because of a high rate of elongation of kappa. When the number of fluids is 10, the best estimate of blue wavelength was 14 μms.

"Evolution of the Stellar Mass--Metallicity Relation - I: Galaxies in the

Cl0024+1654 galaxy cluster at z~0.4 using full spectrum stellar population
synthesis modeling of individual quiescent galaxies. The lower limit of our
stellar mass range is $M_*=10^{9.7}M_\odot$, the lowest galaxy mass at which
individual stellar metallicity has been measured beyond the local universe. We
report a detection of an evolution of the stellar MZR with observed redshift at
$0.037\pm0.007$ dex per Gyr, consistent with the predictions from
hydrodynamical simulations. Additionally, we find that the evolution of the
stellar MZR with observed redshift can be explained by an evolution of the
stellar MZR with their formation time, i.e., when the single stellar population
(SSP)-equivalent ages of galaxies are taken into account. This behavior is
consistent with stars forming out of gas that also has an MZR with a
normalization that decreases with redshift. Lastly, we find that over the
observed mass range, the MZR can be described by a linear function with a
shallow slope, ($[Fe/H] \propto (0.16 \pm 0.03) \log M_*$). The slope suggests
that galaxy feedback, in terms of mass-loading factor, might be
mass-independent over the observed mass and redshift range.

In the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy, the stellar mass of a star was measured with the following method:
The zeroes represent the total number of masses in a solar system. If mass increases significantly in this case, it becomes the mass constant and the zeros denote the distance from the star to the nearest star in time. The zooming functions on a superimposed image of mass are shown in Figure 2B. Since the stars are about 10 times brighter than the surrounding stars in absolute magnitude, this distribution is extremely close to zero. When an image is taken with a zebra (which is not a binary) and a small galaxy (from Figure 3B), the apparent size of this galaxy represents all the known mass in an observable star.

"Adaptive and Iterative Multi-Branch MMSE Decision Feedback Detection
  Algorithms for MIMO Systems","  In this work, decision feedback (DF) detection algorithms based on multiple
processing branches for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing
systems are proposed. The proposed detector employs multiple cancellation
branches with receive filters that are obtained from a common matrix inverse
and achieves a performance close to the maximum likelihood detector (MLD).
Constrained minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receive filters designed with
constraints on the shape and magnitude of the feedback filters for the
multi-branch MMSE DF (MB-MMSE-DF) receivers are presented. An adaptive
implementation of the proposed MB-MMSE-DF detector is developed along with a
recursive least squares-type algorithm for estimating the parameters of the
receive filters when the channel is time-varying. A soft-output version of the
MB-MMSE-DF detector is also proposed as a component of an iterative detection
and decoding receiver structure. A computational complexity analysis shows that
the MB-MMSE-DF detector does not require a significant additional complexity
over the conventional MMSE-DF detector, whereas a diversity analysis discusses
the diversity order achieved by the MB-MMSE-DF detector. Simulation results
show that the MB-MMSE-DF detector achieves a performance superior to existing
suboptimal detectors and close to the MLD, while requiring significantly lower
complexity.

Rabi-coupled Countersuperflow in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates,"  We show theoretically that periodic density patterns are stabilized in two
counter-propagating Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms in different hyperfine
states under Rabi coupling. In the presence of coupling, the relative velocity
between two components is localized around density depressions in
quasi-one-dimensional systems. When the relative velocity is sufficiently
small, the periodic pattern reduces to a periodic array of topological solitons
as kinks of relative phase. According to our variational and numerical
analyses, the soliton solution is well characterized by the soliton width and
density depression. We demonstrate the dependence of the depression and width
on the Rabi frequency and the coupling constant of inter-component
density-density interactions. The periodic pattern of the relative phase
transforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the
period becomes smaller than the soliton width. These patterns become unstable
when the localized relative velocity exceeds a critical value. The
stability-phase diagram of this system is evaluated with a stability analysis
of countersuperflow, by taking into account the finite-size-effect owing to the
density depression.

introduced, which exploits the Grigoriev's flow of the matrix multiplication

developed. The result generalizes a similar bound previously obtained under the
constraint of no-recomputation, that is, that intermediate results cannot be
