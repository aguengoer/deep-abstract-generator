A Latent-Variable Bayesian Nonparametric Regression Model,"  We introduce a random partition model for Bayesian nonparametric regression.
The model is based on infinitely-many disjoint regions of the range of a latent
covariate-dependent Gaussian process. Given a realization of the process, the
cluster of dependent variable responses that share a common region are assumed
to arise from the same distribution. Also, the latent Gaussian process prior
allows for the random partitions (i.e., clusters of the observations) to
exhibit dependencies among one another. The model is illustrated through the
analysis of a real data set arising from education, and through the analysis of
simulated data that were generated from complex data-generating models.

"Emergence of Topological Fermi Liquid from a Strongly Correlated Bosonic
  System in Optical Superlattices","  Recent experiments on quantum degenerate gases give an opportunity for
simulating strongly-correlated electronic systems in optical lattices. It may
shed light on some long-standing puzzles in condensed-matter physics, like the
nature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates that had baffled
people over two decades. It is believed that the two-dimensional fermionic
Hubbard model, or t-J model, contains the key to this problem; but the
difficulty of unveiling the mystery of a strongly-interacting fermionic system
is also generally acknowledged. Here, as a substitute, we systematically
analyze the property of bosonic t-J model simulated in optical superlattices
near unit-filling. In particular, we show the emergence of a strange
topological Fermi liquid with Fermi surfaces from a purely bosonic system. We
also discuss the possibility of observing these phenomena in ultracold atom
experiments. The result may provide some crucial insights into the origin of
high-T_{c} superconductivity.

"Modified FRW cosmologies arising from states of the hybrid quantum Gowdy
  model","  We construct approximate solutions of the hybrid quantum Gowdy cosmology with
three-torus topology, linear polarization, and local rotational symmetry, in
the presence of a massless scalar field. More specifically, we determine some
families of states for which the complicated inhomogeneous and anisotropic
Hamiltonian constraint operator of the Gowdy model is approximated by a much
simpler one. Our quantum states follow the dynamics governed by this simpler
constraint, while being at the same time also approximate solutions of the full
Gowdy model. This is so thanks to the quantum correlations that the considered
states present between the isotropic and anisotropic sectors of the model.
Remarkably, this simpler constraint can be regarded as that of a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe filled with different kinds of perfect
fluids and geometrically corrected by homogeneous and isotropic curvature-like
terms. Therefore, our quantum states, which are intrinsically inhomogeneous,
admit approximate homogeneous and isotropic effective descriptions similar to
those considered in modified theories of gravity.

Huffman Coding as a Non-linear Dynamical System,"  In this paper, source coding or data compression is viewed as a measurement
problem. Given a measurement device with fewer states than the observable of a
stochastic source, how can one capture the essential information? We propose
modeling stochastic sources as piecewise linear discrete chaotic dynamical
systems known as Generalized Lur\""{o}th Series (GLS) which dates back to Georg
Cantor's work in 1869. The Lyapunov exponent of GLS is equal to the Shannon's
entropy of the source (up to a constant of proportionality). By successively
approximating the source with GLS having fewer states (with the closest
Lyapunov exponent), we derive a binary coding algorithm which exhibits minimum
redundancy (the least average codeword length with integer codeword lengths).
This turns out to be a re-discovery of Huffman coding, the popular lossless
compression algorithm used in the JPEG international standard for still image
compression.

Spin Hall effect in iron-based superconductors: A Dirac-point effect,"  We have theoretically explored the intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) in the
iron-based superconductor family with a variety of materials. The study is
motivated by an observation that, in addition to an appreciable spin-orbit
coupling in the Fe 3d states, a character of the band structure in which Dirac
cones appear below the Fermi energy may play a crucial role in producing a
large SHE. Our investigation does indeed predict a substantially large spin
Hall conductivity in the heavily hole-doped regime such as KFe$_2$As$_2$. The
magnitude of the SHE has turned out to be comparable with that for Pt despite a
relatively small spin-orbit coupling, which we identify to come from a huge
contribution from the gap opening induced by the spin-orbit coupling at the
Dirac point, which can become close to the Fermi energy for the heavy hole
doping.

Quantum quench influenced by an excited-state phase transition,"  We analyze excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) in three
schematic (integrable and nonintegrable) models describing a single-mode
bosonic field coupled to a collection of atoms. It is shown that the presence
of the ESQPT in these models affects the quantum relaxation processes following
an abrupt quench in the control parameter. Clear cut evidence of the ESQPT
effects is presented in integrable models, while in the nonintegrable model the
evidence is blurred due to chaotic behavior of the system in the region around
the critical energy.

The MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer calibration pipeline,"  The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) is
the only mid-IR Integral Field Spectrometer on board James Webb Space
Telescope. The complexity of the MRS requires a very specialized pipeline, with
some specific steps not present in other pipelines of JWST instruments, such as
fringe corrections and wavelength offsets, with different algorithms for point
source or extended source data. The MRS pipeline has also two different
variants: the baseline pipeline, optimized for most foreseen science cases, and
the optimal pipeline, where extra steps will be needed for specific science
cases. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the MRS Calibration
Pipeline from uncalibrated slope images to final scientific products, with
brief descriptions of its algorithms, input and output data, and the accessory
data and calibration data products necessary to run the pipeline.

The Role of Pragmatics in Legal Norm Representation,"  Despite the 'apparent clarity' of a given legal provision, its application
may result in an outcome that does not exactly conform to the semantic level of
a statute. The vagueness within a legal text is induced intentionally to
accommodate all possible scenarios under which such norms should be applied,
thus making the role of pragmatics an important aspect also in the
representation of a legal norm and reasoning on top of it. The notion of
pragmatics considered in this paper does not focus on the aspects associated
with judicial decision making. The paper aims to shed light on the aspects of
pragmatics in legal linguistics, mainly focusing on the domain of patent law,
only from a knowledge representation perspective. The philosophical discussions
presented in this paper are grounded based on the legal theories from Grice and
Marmor.

Kantowski-Sachs Einstein-{\ae}ther perfect fluid models,"  We investigate Kantowski-Sachs models in Einstein-{\ae}ther theory with a
perfect fluid source using the singularity analysis to prove the integrability
of the field equations and dynamical system tools to study the evolution. We
find an inflationary source at early times, and an inflationary sink at late
times, for a wide region in the parameter space. The results by A. A. Coley, G.
Leon, P. Sandin and J. Latta (JCAP 12, 010, 2015), are then re-obtained as
particular cases. Additionally, we select other values for the non-GR
parameters which are consistent with current constraints, getting a very rich
phenomenology. In particular, we find solutions with infinite shear, zero
curvature, and infinite matter energy density in comparison with the Hubble
scalar. We also have stiff-like future attractors, anisotropic late-time
attractors, or both, in some special cases. Such results are developed
analytically, and then verified by numerics. Finally, the physical
interpretation of the new critical points is discussed.

"Equivalent Theories Redefine Hamiltonian Observables to Exhibit Change
  in General Relativity","  Change and local spatial variation are missing in canonical General
Relativity's observables as usually defined, part of the problem of time.
Definitions can be tested using equivalent formulations, non-gauge and gauge,
because they must have equivalent observables and everything is observable in
the non-gauge formulation. Taking an observable from the non-gauge formulation
and finding the equivalent in the gauge formulation, one requires that the
equivalent be an observable, constraining definitions. For massive photons, the
de Broglie-Proca non-gauge formulation observable A_{\mu} is equivalent to the
Stueckelberg-Utiyama gauge formulation quantity A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu} \phi.
Thus observables must have 0 Poisson bracket not with each first-class
constraint, but with the Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator
G, a tuned sum of first-class constraints, in accord with the
Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables.
  The definition for external gauge symmetries can be tested using massive
gravity, where one can install gauge freedom by parametrization with clock
fields X^A. The non-gauge observable g^{\mu\nu} has the gauge equivalent
X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu} X^B,_{\nu}. The Poisson bracket of X^A,_{\mu} g^{\mu\nu}
X^B,_{\nu} with G turns out to be not 0 but a Lie derivative. This non-zero
Poisson bracket refines and systematizes Kuchar's proposal to relax the 0
Poisson bracket condition with the Hamiltonian constraint. Thus observables
need covariance, not invariance, in relation to external gauge symmetries.
  The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian for massive gravity are those of General
Relativity + Lambda + 4 scalars, so the same definition of observables applies
to General Relativity. Local fields such as g_{\mu\nu} are observables. Thus
observables change. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent theories
also recovers Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence.

"Gradual Tuning: a better way of Fine Tuning the parameters of a Deep
  Neural Network","  In this paper we present an alternative strategy for fine-tuning the
parameters of a network. We named the technique Gradual Tuning. Once trained on
a first task, the network is fine-tuned on a second task by modifying a
progressively larger set of the network's parameters. We test Gradual Tuning on
different transfer learning tasks, using networks of different sizes trained
with different regularization techniques. The result shows that compared to the
usual fine tuning, our approach significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting
of the initial task, while still retaining comparable if not better performance
on the new task.

"Extracting $\pi\pi$ $S$-wave scattering lengths from cusp effect in
  heavy quarkonium dipion transitions","  Charge-exchange rescattering $\pi^+\pi^-\to \pi^0\pi^0$ leads to a cusp
effect in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass spectrum of processes with
$\pi^0\pi^0$ in the final state which can be used to measure $\pi\pi$ $S$-wave
scattering lengths. Employing a non-relativistic effective field theory, we
discuss the possibility of extracting the scattering lengths in heavy
quarkonium $\pi^0\pi^0$ transitions. The transition
$\Upsilon(3S)\to\Upsilon(2S)\pi^0\pi^0$ is studied in details. We discuss the
precision that can be reached in such an extraction for a certain number of
events.

"Fundamentals of Non-relativistic Collisionless Shock Physics: V.
  Acceleration of Charged Particles","  A comprehensive review is given of the various processes proposed for
accelerating particles by shocks to high energies. These energies are limited
by several bounds: the non-relativistic nature of the heliospheric
collisionless shocks to which this review restricts, the finite size of these
shocks, the finite width of the downstream region, and to the nature of
turbulence. In general, collisionless shocks in the heliosphere cannot
accelerate particles to very high energies. As a fundamental problem of the
acceleration mechanism the injection of see particles is identified. Some
mecchanisms for production of seed particles are invoked. Acceleration of
electrons begins to uncover its nature. The following problems are covered in

"Angular momentum evolution of galaxies over the past 10-Gyr: A MUSE and
  KMOS dynamical survey of 400 star-forming galaxies from z=0.3-1.7","  We present a MUSE and KMOS dynamical study 405 star-forming galaxies at
redshift z=0.28-1.65 (median redshift z=0.84). Our sample are representative of
star-forming, main-sequence galaxies, with star-formation rates of
SFR=0.1-30Mo/yr and stellar masses M=10^8-10^11Mo. For 49+/-4% of our sample,
the dynamics suggest rotational support, 24+/-3% are unresolved systems and
5+/-2% appear to be early-stage major mergers with components on 8-30kpc
scales. The remaining 22+/-5% appear to be dynamically complex, irregular (or
face-on systems). For galaxies whose dynamics suggest rotational support, we
derive inclination corrected rotational velocities and show these systems lie
on a similar scaling between stellar mass and specific angular momentum as
local spirals with j*=J/M*\propto M^(2/3) but with a redshift evolution that
scales as j*\propto M^{2/3}(1+z)^(-1). We identify a correlation between
specific angular momentum and disk stability such that galaxies with the
highest specific angular momentum, log(j*/M^(2/3))>2.5, are the most stable,
with Toomre Q=1.10+/-0.18, compared to Q=0.53+/-0.22 for galaxies with
log(j*/M^(2/3))<2.5. At a fixed mass, the HST morphologies of galaxies with the
highest specific angular momentum resemble spiral galaxies, whilst those with
low specific angular momentum are morphologically complex and dominated by
several bright star-forming regions. This suggests that angular momentum plays
a major role in defining the stability of gas disks: at z~1, massive galaxies
that have disks with low specific angular momentum, appear to be globally
unstable, clumpy and turbulent systems. In contrast, galaxies with high
specific angular have evolved in to stable disks with spiral structures.

"A Novel Approach for Ellipsoidal Outer-Approximation of the Intersection
  Region of Ellipses in the Plane","  In this paper, a novel technique for tight outer-approximation of the
intersection region of a finite number of ellipses in 2-dimensional (2D) space
is proposed. First, the vertices of a tight polygon that contains the convex
intersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so, the
intersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the
intersection region are determined, and a set of points is generated on the
elliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring intersection points. By finding
the tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points, a set of
half-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the
polygon more efficiently, the points are given an order and the intersection of
the half-planes corresponding to every two neighbouring points is calculated.
If the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points together with the
initially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon
is non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate
additional discrete points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the
issue, and restart the algorithm to obtain a bounded and convex polygon.
Finally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the polygon is
obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical
experiments, it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter
outer-approximation of the intersection of multiple ellipses, compared to
conventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational cost.

called steered states. In this work, we study the subset of steered states
which are pure after normalisation. We illustrate that these pure steered
states, if they exist, often carry interesting information about the shared
bipartite state. This information content becomes particularly clear when we
study the purification of the shared state. Some applications are discussed.
These include a generalisation of the fundamental lemma in the so-called
`all-versus-nothing proof of steerability' for systems of arbitrary dimension.

On the K{\L}R conjecture in random graphs,"  The K{\L}R conjecture of Kohayakawa, {\L}uczak, and R\""odl is a statement
that allows one to prove that asymptotically almost surely all subgraphs of the
random graph G_{n,p}, for sufficiently large p : = p(n), satisfy an embedding
lemma which complements the sparse regularity lemma of Kohayakawa and R\""odl.
We prove a variant of this conjecture which is sufficient for most known
applications to random graphs. In particular, our result implies a number of
recent probabilistic versions, due to Conlon, Gowers, and Schacht, of classical
extremal combinatorial theorems. We also discuss several further applications.

Unethical Research: How to Create a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence,"  Cybersecurity research involves publishing papers about malicious exploits as
much as publishing information on how to design tools to protect
cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between ethical hackers
and security experts, which results in a well-balanced cyber-ecosystem. In the
blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering, hundreds of papers have been
published on different proposals geared at the creation of a safe machine, yet
nothing, to our knowledge, has been published on how to design a malevolent
machine. Availability of such information would be of great value particularly
to computer scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI
safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or the
deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect human
activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration of the human
species. This paper provides some general guidelines for the creation of a
Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI).

Hawking Radiation and Entropic Gravity,"  I present a new derivation of Hawking radiation by applying the Crooks
fluctuation theorem to the laws of black hole thermodynamics. Then, by analogy
with the quantum fluctuation theorem, this allows one to identify microstates
contributing to the black hole entropy. These microstates have an evolution
operator on the horizon between initial and final states that is related to the
entropic gravity proposal. Their full calculation perhaps requires a deeper
understanding of nonperturbative Hawking radiation.

"Comment on ""Mass and K Lambda coupling of N*(1535)""","  It is argued in [1] that when the strong coupling to the K Lambda channel is
considered, Breit-Wigner mass of the lightest orbital excitation of the nucleon
N(1535) shifts to a lower value. The new value turned out to be smaller than
the mass of the lightest radial excitation N(1440), which effectively solved
the long-standing problem of conventional constituent quark models. In this
Comment we show that it is not the Breit-Wigner mass of N(1535) that is
decreased, but its bare mass.

"Image-Image Domain Adaptation with Preserved Self-Similarity and
  Domain-Dissimilarity for Person Re-identification","  Person re-identification (re-ID) models trained on one domain often fail to
generalize well to another. In our attempt, we present a ""learning via
translation"" framework. In the baseline, we translate the labeled images from
source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models
with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being an essential part
of this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the
information loss of source-domain labels during translation.
  Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues
contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given
the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image
should be dissimilar to any of the target IDs. To this end, we propose to
preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image
before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated
source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the
similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of
an Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we
show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and
yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets.

"Cosmological evolution and statefinder diagnostic for new holographic
  dark energy model in non flat universe","  In this paper, the holographic dark energy model with new infrared cut-off
proposed by Granda and Oliveros has been investigated in spatially non flat
universe. The dependency of the evolution of equation of state, deceleration
parameter and cosmological evolution of Hubble parameter on the parameters of
new HDE model are calculated. Also, the statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$ in
this model are derived and the evolutionary trajectories in $s-r$ plane are
plotted. We show that the evolutionary trajectories are dependent on the model
parameters of new HDE model. Eventually, in the light of SNe+BAO+OHD+CMB
observational data, we plot the evolutionary trajectories in $s-r$ and $q-r$
planes for best fit values of the parameters of new HDE model.

the dual space of the Lie algebra of the group and the coadjoint action are
illustrated through the Camassa-Holm equation (CH). In 1996 Misio{\l}ek
observed that CH is a geodesic flow equation on the group of diffeomorphisms,
preserving the $H^1$ metric. This example is analogous to the Euler equations
in hydrodynamics, which describe geodesic flow for a right-invariant metric on
the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms preserving the volume element
of the domain of fluid flow and to the Euler equations of rigid body whith a
fixed point, describing geodesics for a left-invariant metric on SO(3). The
momentum map and an explicit parametrization of the Virasoro group, related to
recently obtained solutions for the CH equation are presented.

"Joint analysis of functional genomic data and genome-wide association
  studies of 18 human traits","  Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for
interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We
describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across
the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted
for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple
types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits,
including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels,
height, BMI, and Crohn's disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of
450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers,
and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We
show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein
sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL
cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs
associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I
hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for
example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS
using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with
high-confidence associations by around 5%.

Waves as the source of apparent twisting motions in sunspot penumbrae,"  The motion of dark striations across bright filaments in a sunspot penumbra
has become an important new diagnostic of convective gas flows in penumbral
filaments. The nature of these striations has, however, remained unclear. Here
we present an analysis of small scale motions in penumbral filaments in both
simulations and observations. The simulations, when viewed from above, show
fine structure with dark lanes running outwards from the dark core of the
penumbral filaments. The dark lanes either occur preferentially on one side or
alternate between both sides of the filament. We identify this fine structure
with transverse (kink) oscillations of the filament, corresponding to a
sideways swaying of the filament. These oscillations have periods in the range
of 5-7 min and propagate outward and downward along the filament. Similar
features are found in observed G-band intensity time series of penumbral
filaments in a sunspot located near disk center obtained by the Broadband
Filter Imager (BFI) on board {\it Hinode}. We also find that some filaments
show dark striations moving to both sides of the filaments. Based on the
agreement between simulations and observations we conclude that the motions of
these striations are caused by transverse oscillations of the underlying bright
filaments.

SOA Governance - Road into Maturity,"  There is a general consensus that SOA benefits could be reached but it is
unclear how to achieve this. Research shows that the problems with SOA
governance in practice are among the major reasons of SOA failures. Based on a
literature review, this study first proposes a list of SOA aspects to be
considered when implementing SOA governance. By adopting an interpretive
research methodology based on interviews, this research paper makes two
contributions: it addresses the practical matters that are major concerns for
organisations to achieve a higher maturity level with their SOA, and it reveals
the importance of the key SOA aspects in building strong governance and
consequently reaching a higher maturity level. The expected result should
deliver a theoretical contribution to SOA maturity in relation to SOA
governance; it could provide organisations with new awareness in assessing
their level of maturity and provide recommendations.

"Using content features to enhance performance of user-based
  collaborative filtering performance of user-based collaborative filtering","  Content-based and collaborative filtering methods are the most successful
solutions in recommender systems. Content based method is based on items
attributes. This method checks the features of users favourite items and then
proposes the items which have the most similar characteristics with those
items. Collaborative filtering method is based on the determination of similar
items or similar users, which are called item-based and user-based
collaborative filtering, respectively.In this paper we propose a hybrid method
that integrates collaborative filtering and content-based methods. The proposed
method can be viewed as user-based Collaborative filtering technique. However
to find users with similar taste with active user, we used content features of
the item under investigation to put more emphasis on users rating for similar
items. In other words two users are similar if their ratings are similar on
items that have similar context. This is achieved by assigning a weight to each
rating when calculating the similarity of two users.We used movielens data set
to access the performance of the proposed method in comparison with basic
user-based collaborative filtering and other popular methods.

Anderson Localization at Band Edges for Random Magnetic Fields,"  We consider a magnetic Schr\""odinger operator in two dimensions. The magnetic

well as a magnetic field which are both periodic. We show that the spectrum of
this operator is contained in broadened bands around the Landau levels and that
the edges of these bands consist of pure point spectrum with exponentially
decaying eigenfunctions. The proof is based on a recent Wegner estimate
obtained in \cite{EH2} and a multiscale analysis.

"GMC Collisions as Triggers of Star Formation. III. Density and
  Magnetically Regulated Star Formation","  We study giant molecular cloud (GMC) collisions and their ability to trigger
star cluster formation. We further develop our three dimensional magnetized,
turbulent, colliding GMC simulations by implementing star formation sub-grid
models. Two such models are explored: (1) ""Density-Regulated,"" i.e., fixed
efficiency per free-fall time above a set density threshold; (2)
""Magnetically-Regulated,"" i.e., fixed efficiency per free-fall time in regions
that are magnetically supercritical. Variations of parameters associated with
these models are also explored. In the non-colliding simulations, the overall
level of star formation is sensitive to model parameter choices that relate to
effective density thresholds. In the GMC collision simulations, the final star
formation rates and efficiencies are relatively independent of these
parameters. Between non-colliding and colliding cases, we compare the
morphologies of the resulting star clusters, properties of star-forming gas,
time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), spatial clustering of the
stars, and resulting kinematics of the stars in comparison to the natal gas. We
find that typical collisions, by creating larger amounts of dense gas, trigger
earlier and enhanced star formation, resulting in 10 times higher SFRs and
efficiencies. The star clusters formed from GMC collisions show greater spatial
sub-structure and more disturbed kinematics.

of both diffractive elements, produces an azimuthal cosine-profiled modulation
on their diffractograms. It destroys the vortex characteristics of their
diffraction fields.

comparing these numerically exact calculations against the predictions based on

On generalized Ces\`aro stable functions,"  The notion of Ces\`aro stable function is generalized by introducing Ces\`aro
mean of type $(b-1;c)$ which give rise to a new concept of generalized Ces\`aro
stable function. As an application of generalized Ces\`aro stable functions we
also prove for a convex function of order $\lambda\in[1/2,1)$, its Ces\`aro
mean of type $(b-1;c)$ is close-to-convex of order $\lambda$. Further two
conjectures are also posed in the direction of generalized Ces\`aro stable
function. Some particular cases of these conjectures are also discussed.

"Ab initio prediction of magnetically dead layers in freestanding
  $\gamma$-Ce(111)","  It is well known that the surface of nonmagnetic $\alpha$-Ce is magnetically
ordered, i.e., $\gamma$-like. One then might conjecture, in agreement with
previous theoretical predictions, that the $\gamma$-Ce may also exhibit at its
surfaces even more strongly enhanced $\gamma$-like magnetic ordering.
Nonetheless, our result shows that the (111)-surfaces of magnetic $\gamma$-Ce
are neither spin nor orbitally polarized, i.e., $\alpha$-like. Therefore, we
predict, in contrast to the nonmagnetic $\alpha$-phase which tends to produce
magnetically ordered $\gamma$-like thin layers at its free surfaces, the
magnetic $\gamma$-phase has a tendency to form $\alpha$-like dead layers. This
study, which explains the suppressed (promoted) surface magnetic moments of
$\gamma$-Ce ($\alpha$-Ce), shows that how nanoscale can reverse physical
properties by going from bulk to the surface in isostructural $\alpha$- and
$\gamma$-phases of cerium. We predict using our freestanding surface results
that a typical unreactive and non-diffusive substrate can dramatically
influence the magnetic surface of cerium thin films in contrast to most of the
uncorrelated thin films and strongly correlated transition metals. Our result
implies that magnetic surface moments of $\alpha$-Ce(111) can be suddenly

"Current-induced spin polarization for a general two-dimensional electron
  system","  In this paper, current-induced spin polarization for two-dimensional electron
gas with a general spin-orbit interaction is investigated. For isotropic energy
spectrum, the in-plane current-induced spin polarization is found to be
dependent on the electron density for non-linear spin-orbit interaction and
increases with the increment of sheet density, in contrast to the case for $\bm
k$-linear spin-orbit coupling model. The numerical evaluation is performed for
InAs/InSb heterojunction with spin-orbit coupling of both linear and cubic
spin-orbit coupling types. For $\delta$-type short-range electron-impurity
scattering, it is found that the current-induced spin polarization increases
with increasing the density when cubic spin-orbit couplings are considered.
However, for remote disorders, a rapid enhancement of current-induced spin
polarization is always observed at high electron density, even in the case
without cubic spin-orbit coupling. This result demonstrates the
collision-related feature of current-induced spin polarization. The effects of
different high order spin-orbit couplings on spin polarization can be
comparable.

"A high-order nonconservative approach for hyperbolic equations in fluid
  dynamics","  It is well known, thanks to Lax-Wendroff theorem, that the local conservation
of a numerical scheme for a conservative hyperbolic system is a simple and
systematic way to guarantee that, if stable, a scheme will provide a sequence
of solutions that will converge to a weak solution of the continuous problem.
In [1], it is shown that a nonconservative scheme will not provide a good
solution. The question of using, nevertheless, a nonconservative formulation of
the system and getting the correct solution has been a long-standing debate. In
this paper, we show how get a relevant weak solution from a pressure-based
formulation of the Euler equations of fluid mechanics. This is useful when
dealing with nonlinear equations of state because it is easier to compute the
internal energy from the pressure than the opposite. This makes it possible to
get oscillation free solutions, contrarily to classical conservative methods.
An extension to multiphase flows is also discussed, as well as a
multidimensional extension.

"Decentralized Stochastic Control with Partial History Sharing: A Common
  Information Approach","  A general model of decentralized stochastic control called partial history
sharing information structure is presented. In this model, at each step the
controllers share part of their observation and control history with each
other. This general model subsumes several existing models of information
sharing as special cases. Based on the information commonly known to all the
controllers, the decentralized problem is reformulated as an equivalent
centralized problem from the perspective of a coordinator. The coordinator
knows the common information and select prescriptions that map each
controller's local information to its control actions. The optimal control
problem at the coordinator is shown to be a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) which is solved using techniques from Markov decision
theory. This approach provides (a) structural results for optimal strategies,
and (b) a dynamic program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers
in the original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various
ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural results
on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach cannot be
obtained by the existing generic approach (the person-by-person approach) for
obtaining structural results in decentralized problems; and the dynamic program
obtained by the proposed approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing
generic approach (the designer's approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in
decentralized problems.

"Halo Retention and Evolution of Coalescing Compact Binaries in
  Cosmological Simulations of Structure Formation: Implications for Short
  Gamma-Ray Bursts","  Merging compact binaries are the one source of gravitational radiation so far
identified. Because short-period systems which will merge in less than a Hubble
time have already been observed as binary pulsars, they are important both as
gravitational wave sources for observatories such as LIGO but also as
progenitors for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). The fact that these systems
must have large systemic velocities implies that by the time they merge, they
will be far from their formation site. The locations of merging sites depend
sensitively on the gravitational potential of the galaxy host, which until now
has been assumed to be static. Here we refine such calculations to incorporate
the temporal evolution of the host's gravitational potential as well as that of
its nearby neighbors using cosmological simulations of structure formation.
This results in merger site distributions that are more diffusively distributed
with respect to their putative hosts, with locations extending out to distances
of a few Mpc for lighter halos. The degree of mixing between neighboring
compact binary populations computed in this way is severely enhanced in
environments with a high number density of galaxies. We find that SGRB redshift
estimates based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can be very
inaccurate, if progenitor systems inhere large systematic kicks at birth.

"Anti-Stokes scattering and Stokes scattering of stimulated Brillouin
  scattering cascade in high-intensity laser-plasmas interaction","  The anti-Stokes scattering and Stokes scattering in stimulated Brillouin
scattering (SBS) cascade have been researched by the Vlasov-Maxwell simulation.
In the high-intensity laser-plasmas interaction, the stimulated anti-Stokes
Brillouin scattering (SABS) will occur after the second stage SBS rescattering.
The mechanism of SABS has been put forward to explain this phenomenon. And the
SABS will compete with the SBS rescattering to determine the total SBS
reflectivity. Thus, the SBS rescattering including the SABS is an important
saturation mechanism of SBS, and should be taken into account in the
high-intensity laser-plasmas interaction.

Can mosquitoes fly in the rain?,"  Collisions with raindrops are one of many obstacles insects face during
flight. In this fluid dynamics video, we present a series of high-speed films
of impacts between mosquitoes and raindrops. We also present drop impacts upon
insect mimics, which are unsupported styrofoam balls of the same mass as
mosquitoes. High-speed videography and particle tracking during collision are
employed to determine the insect position versus time. We determine the
magnitude of acceleration by considering the momentum transfer and impact
duration. Experiments with live mosquitoes indicate a surprising ability to
quickly recover flight post-collision, despite accelerations of 30-300
gravities over durations of 1 ms.

Secret Key Cryptosystem based on Polar Codes over Binary Erasure Channel,"  This paper proposes an efficient secret key cryptosystem based on polar codes
over Binary Erasure Channel. We introduce a method, for the first time to our
knowledge, to hide the generator matrix of the polar codes from an attacker. In
fact, our main goal is to achieve secure and reliable communication using
finite-length polar codes. The proposed cryptosystem has a significant security
advantage against chosen plaintext attacks in comparison with the Rao-Nam
cryptosystem. Also, the key length is decreased after applying a new
compression algorithm. Moreover, this scheme benefits from high code rate and
proper error performance for reliable communication.

Visual Words for Automatic Lip-Reading,"  Lip reading is used to understand or interpret speech without hearing it, a
technique especially mastered by people with hearing difficulties. The ability
to lip read enables a person with a hearing impairment to communicate with
others and to engage in social activities, which otherwise would be difficult.
Recent advances in the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, and
signal processing has led to a growing interest in automating this challenging
task of lip reading. Indeed, automating the human ability to lip read, a
process referred to as visual speech recognition, could open the door for other
novel applications. This thesis investigates various issues faced by an
automated lip-reading system and proposes a novel ""visual words"" based approach
to automatic lip reading. The proposed approach includes a novel automatic face
localisation scheme and a lip localisation method.

  contributions to phase-resolved optical two-dimensional Fourier-transform
  spectra","  We study the coherent light-matter interactions of GaAs quantum wells
associated with excitons, biexcitons and many-body effects. For most
polarization configurations, excitonic features dominate the phase-resolved
two-dimensional Fourier-transform (2DFT) spectra and have dispersive

excitation, excitonic features become weak and absorptive due to the strong
suppression of many-body effects; a result that can not be directly determined
in transient four-wave mixing experiments. The biexcitonic features do not
weaken for cross-polarized excitation and thus are more important.

On the class of caustic on the moduli space of odd spin curves,"  Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 3$ and let $\eta$ be an
odd theta characteristic on it such that $h^0(C,\eta) = 1$. Pick a point $p$
from the support of $\eta$ and consider the one-dimensional linear system
$|\eta + p|$. In general this linear system is base-point free and all its
ramification points (i.e. ramification points of the corresponding branched
cover $C\to\mathbb P^1\simeq \mathbb PH^0(C,\eta+p)$) are simple. We study the
locus in the moduli space of odd spin curves where the linear system $|\eta +
p|$ fails to have this general behavior. This locus splits into a union of
three divisors: the first divisor corresponds to the case when $|\eta+p|$ has a
base point, the second one corresponds to theta characteristics which are not
reduced at $p$ (and therefore $|\eta + p|$ must have a triple point at $p$) and
the third one corresponds to the case when $|\eta + p|$ has a triple point
different from $p$. The second divisor was studied by G. Farkas and A. Verra
in\cite{FARo} where its expansion in the rational Picard group was used to
prove that the moduli space of odd spin curves is of general type for genus at
least $12$. We call the first divisor a Base Point divisor and the third one a
Caustic divisor (following Arnold terminology for Hurwitz spases). The
objective of this paper is to expand these two divisors via the set of standard
generators in the rational Picard group of the moduli space of odd spin curves.

Characterization and Photometric Membership of the Open Cluster NGC1981,"  Open clusters belonging to star-forming complexes are the leftovers from the
initial stellar generations. The study of these young systems provides
constraints to models of star formation and evolution as well as to the
properties of the Galactic disc. We aimed at investigating NGC1981, a young
open cluster in the Orion Nebula Region, using near-IR and BV (RI)C photometric
data.We devised a method that accounts for the field contamination and allows
to derive photometric membership for the cluster stars. A new cluster centre
was determined by Gaussian fittings to the 2-D stellar distribution on the sky,
and has been used used to obtain the radial stellar density profile and the
structural parameters. Mass functions were computed for stars inside the
cluster limiting radius and total mass estimated from them. Although more
easily distinguished by its grouping of 6 relatively bright stars, an
underlying population of faint pre-main sequence stars is evident in the
cluster area. We showed that this population is related to the cluster itself
rather than to the nearby Orion Nebula cluster. Additionally a fraction of the
cluster low mass stars may have been evaporated from the region in its early
evolution leading to the present sparse, loose structure. The estimated
parameters of NGC1981 are core radius Rc = 0.09 +/- 0.04 pc, limiting radius
Rlim = 1.21+/-0.11 pc, age t = 5+/-1 Myr, distance modulus (m-M)0 = 7.9+/-0.1

Discretisations of rough stochastic PDEs,"  We develop a general framework for spatial discretisations of parabolic
stochastic PDEs whose solutions are provided in the framework of the theory of
regularity structures and which are functions in time. As an application, we
show that the dynamical $\Phi^4_3$ model on the dyadic grid converges after
renormalisation to its continuous counterpart. This result in particular
implies that, as expected, the $\Phi^4_3$ measure with a sufficiently small
coupling constant is invariant for this equation and that the lifetime of its
solutions is almost surely infinite for almost every initial condition.

"Charge-spin-orbital Fluctuations in Mixed Valence Spinels: Comparative
  Study of AlV2O4 and LiV2O4","  Mixed valence spinels provide a fertile playground for the interplay between
charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom in strongly correlated electrons
on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Among them, AlV$_2$O$_4$ and
LiV$_2$O$_4$ exhibit contrasting and puzzling behavior: self-organization of
seven-site clusters and heavy fermion behavior. We theoretically perform a
comparative study of charge-spin-orbital fluctuations in these two compounds,
on the basis of the multiband Hubbard models constructed by using the
maximally-localized Wannier functions obtained from the ab initio band
calculations. Performing the eigenmode analysis of the generalized
susceptibility, we find that, in AlV$_2$O$_4$, the relevant fluctuation appears
in the charge sector in $\sigma$-bonding type orbitals. In contrast, in
LiV$_2$O$_4$, optical-type spin fluctuations in the $a_{\rm 1g}$ orbital are
enhanced at an incommensurate wave number at low temperature. Implications from
the comparative study are discussed for the contrasting behavior, including the
metal-insulator transition under pressure in LiV$_2$O$_4$.

Instability of rotating black holes: large D analysis,"  We study the stability of odd-dimensional rotating black holes with equal
angular momenta by performing an expansion in the inverse of the number of
dimensions D. Universality at large $D$ allows us to calculate analytically the
complex frequency of quasinormal modes to next-to-leading order in the
expansion. We identify the onset of non-axisymmetric, bar-mode instabilities at
a specific finite rotation, and axisymmetric instabilities at larger rotation.
The former occur at the threshold where the modes become superradiant, and
before the ultraspinning regime is reached. Our results fully confirm the
picture found in numerical studies, with very good quantitative agreement. We
extend the analysis to the same class of black holes in Anti-deSitter space,
and find the same qualitative features. We also discuss the appearance at high
frequencies of the universal set of (stable) quasinormal modes.

Progressive transformation of a flux rope to an ICME,"  The solar wind conditions at one astronomical unit (AU) can be strongly
disturbed by the interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset,
called magnetic clouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an
important amount of magnetic flux and helicity which is released in CMEs. At 1
AU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting
their expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs
present a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and
significantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 and 10
November, 2004. After determining an approximated orientation for the flux rope
using the minimum variance method, we precise the orientation of the cloud axis
relating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method.
This method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux
between the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact
parameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft
trajectory and the cloud axis). Moreover, using the direct method, we find that
the ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent
magnetic region. These observations are interpreted considering the existence
of a previous larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its

Circular chromatic number of induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs,"  Investigating the equality of the chromatic number and the circular chromatic
number of graphs has been an active stream of research for last decades. In
this regard, Habolhassan and Zhu [Circular chromatic number of Kneser graphs,
Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B, 2003] proved that if $n$ is
sufficiently large with respect to $k$, then the Schrijver graph ${\rm
SG}(n,k)$ has the same chromatic and circular chromatic number. Later, Meunier
[A topological lower bound for the circular chromatic number of Schrijver
graphs, Journal of Graph Theory, 2005] and independently, Simonyi and Tardos [
Local chromatic number, Ky Fan's theorem and circular colorings, Combinatorica,
2006] proved that $\chi({\rm SG}(n,k))=\chi_c({\rm SG}(n,k))$ if $n$ is even.
In this paper, we study the circular chromatic number of induced subgraphs of
Kneser graphs. In this regard, we shall first generalize the preceding result
to $s$-stable Kneser graphs. Furthermore, as a generalization of Hajiabolhassan
and Zhu's result, we prove that if $n$ is large enough with respect to $k$,
then any sufficiently large induced subgraph of the Kneser graph ${\rm
KG}(n,k)$ has the same chromatic number and circular chromatic number.

"Vlasov equation and $N$-body dynamics - How central is particle dynamics
  to our understanding of plasmas?","  Difficulties in founding microscopically the Vlasov equation for
Coulomb-interacting particles are recalled for both the statistical approach

(characteristics) in the analysis of the partial differential Vlasov--Poisson
system is stressed. Starting from many-body dynamics, a direct derivation of
both Debye shielding and collective behaviour is sketched.

Super-sequences in the arc component of a compact connected group,"  Let G be an abelian topological group. The symbol \hat{G} denotes the group
of all continuous characters \chi : G --> T endowed with the compact open
topology. A subset E of G is said to be qc-dense in G provided that \chi(E)
\subseteq \phi([-1/4,1/4]) holds only for the trivial character \chi \in
\hat{G}, where \phi : R --> T = R/Z is the canonical homomorphism. A
super-sequence is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space S with at most one
non-isolated point (to which S converges). We prove that an infinite compact
abelian group G is connected if and only if its arc component G_a contains a
super-sequence converging to 0 that is qc-dense in G. This gives as a corollary
a recent theorem of Aussenhofer: For a connected locally compact abelian group
G, the restriction homomorphism r : \hat{G} --> \hat{G}_a defined by r(\chi) =
\chi\restriction_{G_a} for \chi \in \hat{G}, is a topological isomorphism. We
also show that an infinite compact group G is connected if and only if its arc
component G_a contains a super-sequence S converging to the identity e that
generates a dense subgroup of G (equivalently, S \setminus {e} is an infinite
suitable set for G in the sense of Hofmann and Morris).

X-ray spectroscopy of the hot has in the M31 bulge,"  We present an X-ray spectroscopic study of the nuclear region of the M31
bulge, based on observations of the Xmm-Newton Reflection Grating
Spectrometers. The obtained high-resolution grating spectra clearly show
individual emission lines of highly-ionized iron and oxygen, which
unambiguously confirm the presence of diffuse hot gas in the bulge, as
indicated from previous X-ray CCD imaging studies. We model the spectra with
detailed Monte-Carlo simulations, which provide a robust spectroscopic estimate
of the hot gas temperature $\sim0.29$ keV and the O/Fe ratio $\sim0.3$ solar.
The results indicate that iron ejecta of type Ia supernovae are partly-mixed
with the hot gas. The observed spectra show an intensity excess at the OVII
triplet, which most likely represents emission from charge exchanges at the
interface between the hot gas and a known cool gas spiral in the same nuclear
region.

"Not In Our Backyard: Spectroscopic Support for the CLASH z=11 Candidate
  MACS0647-JD","  We report on our first set of spectroscopic Hubble Space Telescope
observations of the z~11 candidate galaxy strongly lensed by the
MACSJ0647.7+7015 galaxy cluster. The three lensed images are faint and we show
that these early slitless grism observations are of sufficient depth to
investigate whether this high-redshift candidate, identified by its strong
photometric break at ~1.5 micron, could possibly be an emission line galaxy at
a much lower redshift. While such an interloper would imply the existence of a
rather peculiar object, we show here that such strong emission lines would
clearly have been detected. Comparing realistic, two-dimensional simulations to
these new observations we would expect the necessary emission lines to be
detected at >5 sigma while we see no evidence for such lines in the dispersed
data of any of the three lensed images. We therefore exclude that this object
could be a low redshift emission line interloper, which significantly increases
the likelihood of this candidate being a bona fide z~11 galaxy.

Nonlinear simulations of the convection-pulsation coupling,"  In cold Cepheids close to the red edge of the classical instability strip, a
strong coupling between the stellar pulsations and the surface convective
motions occurs. This coupling is by now poorly described by 1-D models of
convection, the so-called ""time-dependent convection models"" (TDC). The
intrinsic weakness of such models comes from the large number of unconstrained
free parameters entering in the description of turbulent convection. A way to
overcome these limits is to compute two-dimensional direct simulations (DNS),
in which all the nonlinearities are correctly solved. Two-dimensional DNS of
the convection-pulsation coupling are presented here. In an appropriate
parameter regime, convective motions can actually quench the radial pulsations
of the star, as suspected in Cepheids close to the red edge of the instability
strip. These nonlinear simulations can also be used to determine the limits and
the relevance of the TDC models.

"Which type of citation analysis generates the most accurate taxonomy of
  scientific and technical knowledge?","  In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy
of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for
science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to
be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing
citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories.
Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous
work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those
studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the
accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using
direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new
gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct
citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic
coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of
references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more
accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge
than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that
discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate
compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.

"Augmented Reality Meets Computer Vision : Efficient Data Generation for
  Urban Driving Scenes","  The success of deep learning in computer vision is based on availability of
large annotated datasets. To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually
rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Creating realistic 3D
content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In
this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic
data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models.
Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for
this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the
target category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap,
and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating
complex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to
augment real images with virtual objects. This allows us to create realistic
composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance and a large
number of complex object arrangements. In contrast to modeling complete 3D
environments, our augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions
in combination with 3D shapes of the target object. Through extensive
experimentation, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented
data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation
models. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on training
standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of
cars in outdoor driving scenes. We test the models trained on our augmented
data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate
ground truth, and on Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that
models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on
synthetic data or models trained on limited amount of annotated real data.

"Wetting in a two-dimensional capped capillary. Part II: Three-phase
  coexistence","  In Part II of this study we consider two cases of three-phase coexistence.
First, the capped capillary may allow for vapour, drop-like, and slab-like
phases to coexist at the same values of temperature and chemical potential.
Second, the slit pore forming the bulk of the capped capillary may allow for
the coexistence between vapour, planar prewetting film and capillary-liquid.
While the consideration of the former case allows us to summarise the
phenomenology presented in Part I and to show that the transition line of wedge
prewetting is shifted in capillary-like geometries by a constant value,
depending on the capillary width, the careful examination of the latter case
allows us to uncover a new phase transition in confined fluids, a continuous
planar prewetting transition. A planar prewetting transition is known to be a
distinctly first-order phenomenon, and typically taking place on the scale of
several atomic diameters. A continuous prewetting transition, on the other
hand, is scale invariant. Thus, apart from being of fundamental significance,
this finding has potential for facilitating experimental detection as well as
measurements of planar prewetting. Further, we provide proof for the existence
of a tri-critical point of the three-phase coexistence line of the capped
capillary while by considering a dynamic model of wetting we show how the
relaxation of the system can be pinned by a metastable state. We present a full
parametric study of our model system and support our findings with exhaustive
examples of density profiles, adsorption and free energy isotherms, and full
phase diagrams.

"Generic Regularities in Quasienergy Spectra and Free Quantum Dynamics
  Independently of Chaos Strength","  Generic and significant regularities are shown to occur in the quasienergy
spectra of the generalized quantum kicked particle for arbitrary quasimomentum,
a quantity most relevant in atom-optics experimental realizations of this
paradigmatic nonintegrable system. The spectral regularities are basically
different from the usual ones associated with ordered regions in a mixed phase
space, since they are \emph{completely independent} of the chaos strength.
Their origin are free-motion features unaffected by the nonintegrability. The
generic regularities are \emph{dense} subspectra, each being either a regular
level sequence with approximately a Poisson level-spacing distribution or a
ladder of equally-spaced levels. The quantum dynamics associated with each
regular subspectrum is essentially \emph{free} for \emph{arbitrarily strong}
chaos.

"Single-molecule-mediated heat current between an electronic and a
  bosonic bath","  In molecular devices electronic degrees of freedom are coupled to vibrational
modes of the molecule, offering an opportunity to study fundamental aspects of
this coupling between at the nanoscale. To this end we consider the
nonequilibrium heat exchange between a conduction band and a bosonic bath
mediated by a single molecule. For molecules large enough so that on-site
interactions can be dropped we carry out an asymptotically exact calculation of
the heat current, governed by the smallness of the electron-phonon coupling,
and obtain the steady state heat current driven by a finite temperature drop.
At low temperatures the heat current is found to have a power-law behavior with
respect to the temperature difference with the power depending on the nature of
the bosonic bath. At high temperatures, on the other hand, the current is
linear in the temperature difference for all types of bosonic baths. The
crossover between these behaviors is described. Some of the results are given a
physical explanation by comparing to a perturbative Master equation calculation
(whose limitation we examine).

Random walk based in-network computation of arbitrary functions,"  We study in-network computation on general network topologies. Specifically,
we are given the description of a function, and a network with distinct nodes
at which the operands of the function are made available, and a designated sink
where the computed value of the function is to be consumed. We want to compute
the function during the process of moving the data towards the sink. Such
settings have been studied in the literature, but mainly for symmetric
functions, e.g. average, parity etc., which have the specific property that the
output is invariant to permutation of the operands. To the best of our
knowledge, we present the first fully decentralised algorithms for arbitrary
functions, which we model as those functions whose computation schema is
structured as a binary tree. We propose two algorithms, Fixed Random-Compute
and Flexible Random-Compute, for this problem, both of which use simple random
walks on the network as their basic primitive. Assuming a stochastic model for
the generation of streams of data at each source, we provide a lower and an
upper bound on the rate at which Fixed Random-Compute can compute the stream of
associated function values. Note that the lower bound on rate though computed
for our algorithm serves as a general lower bound for the function computation
problem and to the best of our knowledge is first such lower bound for
asymmetric functions. We also provide upper bounds on the average time taken to
compute the function, characterising this time in terms of the fundamental
parameters of the random walk on the network: the hitting time in the case of

"Two-Stage Stochastic International Portfolio Optimisation under
  Regular-Vine-Copula-Based Scenarios","  In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic international portfolio
optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both
assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a
""currency overlay"", or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to
provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency
exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are
also included.
  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return
distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine
copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of
the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and
asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the
uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio
optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated
from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a
standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the
proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios
that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario
generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return
compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher
returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in
uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.

Continuum models of collective cell migration,"  Collective cell migration plays a central role in tissue development,
morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer progression. With the growing
realization that physical forces mediate cell motility in development and
physiology, a key biological question is how cells integrate molecular
activities for force generation on multicellular scales. In this review we
discuss recent advances in modeling collective cell migration using
quantitative tools and approaches rooted in soft matter physics. We focus on
theoretical models of cell aggregates as continuous active media, where the
feedback between mechanical forces and regulatory biochemistry gives rise to
rich collective dynamical behavior. This class of models provides a powerful
predictive framework for the physiological dynamics that underlies many
developmental processes, where cells need to collectively migrate like a
viscous fluid to reach a target region, and then stiffen to support mechanical
stresses and maintain tissue cohesion.

"Automation of Mobile Pick and Place Robotic System for Small Food
  Industry","  The use of robotics in food industry is becoming more popular in recent
years. The trend seems to continue as long as the robotics technology meets
diverse and challenging needs of the food producers. Rapid developments in
digital computers and control systems technologies have significant impact in
robotics like any other engineering fields. By utilizing new hardware and
software tools, design of these complex systems that need strong integration of
distinct disciplines is no longer difficult compared to the past. Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to design and implement a micro-controller based
on reliable and high performance robotic system for food / biscuit
manufacturing line. We propose a design of a vehicle. The robot is capable of
picking unbaked biscuits tray and places them into furnace and then after
baking it picks the biscuits tray from the furnace. A special gripper is
designed to pick and place the biscuits tray with flexibility.

"Billion-atom Synchronous Parallel Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of
  Critical 3D Ising Systems","  An extension of the synchronous parallel kinetic Monte Carlo (pkMC) algorithm
developed by Martinez {\it et al} [{\it J.\ Comp.\ Phys.} {\bf 227} (2008)
3804] to discrete lattices is presented. The method solves the master equation
synchronously by recourse to null events that keep all processors time clocks
current in a global sense. Boundary conflicts are rigorously solved by adopting
a chessboard decomposition into non-interacting sublattices. We find that the
bias introduced by the spatial correlations attendant to the sublattice
decomposition is within the standard deviation of the serial method, which
confirms the statistical validity of the method. We have assessed the parallel
efficiency of the method and find that our algorithm scales consistently with
problem size and sublattice partition. We apply the method to the calculation
of scale-dependent critical exponents in billion-atom 3D Ising systems, with
very good agreement with state-of-the-art multispin simulations.

Anomaly in the heat capacity of Kondo superconductors,"  Using numerical renormalization group we study thermodynamic properties of a
magnetic impurity described by the Anderson impurity model in a superconducting
host material described by the BCS Hamiltonian. When the Kondo temperature in
the normal state, T_K, is comparable to the critical temperature of the
superconducting transition, T_c, the magnetic doublet state may become
degenerate with the Kondo singlet state, leading to a ln3 peak in the
temperature dependence of the impurity contribution to the entropy. This
entropy increase translates into an anomalous feature in the heat capacity
which might have already been experimentally observed.

"High resolution nanofocus X-ray source based on ultracold electrons from
  laser cooled-atoms","  X-ray 3D tomography is So far limited to micron resolution because of the
large focusing spot of the focused electron beam on the metal target. Here, we
proposed a nanofocous X-ray 3D tomography system based on focused electrons
from laser-cooled atoms in a nanoscale region of metal target in vacuum useful
for 3D nanotomography and submicron volumetric imaging. We have shown the
system has submicron resolution because of ability of focusing cold electrons
to submicron size, the smaller the X-ray focal spot, the higher the resolution
will be. In our system flux through the specimen of (photons/mm^2/s) can be
improved by sub-micron focusing of X-ray radiation as well. In contrast,
synchrotrons and X-ray tubes provide intense radiation beams, however, these
attributes are not necessary for microtomography and the proposed
sub-microfocus source compares favorably with respect to the radiation flux
because of ability of sub-micron focusing of electrons from near-threshold
photoionizing laser cooled atoms.

"Multi-height Scattering Phase Shifts From Sunspots And Phase Differences
  Between Photospheric Heights With SDO/HMI and AIA Data","  Following Couvidat (2013), we analyze data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instruments onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory: Doppler velocity and continuum intensity at 6173 A
as well as intensity maps at 1600 A and 1700 A. Datasets of 14 active regions
and four quiet-Sun regions are studied at four heights in the solar
photosphere. An Hankel-Fourier analysis is performed around these regions of
interest. Outgoing-ingoing scattering phase shifts at a given atmospheric
height are computed, as well as ingoing-ingoing and outgoing-outgoing phase
differences between two atmospheric heights. The outgoing-ingoing phase shifts
produced by sunspots show little dependence on measurement height, unlike the
acoustic power reduction measured in Couvidat (2013). Phenomena happening above
continuum level, like acoustic glories, appear not to have a significant effect
on the phases. However there is a strong dependence on sunspot size,
line-of-sight magnetic flux, and intensity contrast. As previously suggested by
other groups, the region of wave scattering appears both horizontally smaller
and vertically less extended than the region of acoustic power suppression, and
occurs closer to the surface. Results presented here should help refine
theoretical models of acoustic wave scattering by magnetic fields.
Ingoing-ingoing phase differences between two measurement heights are also
computed and show a complex pattern highly dependent on atmospheric height. In
particular, a significant sensitivity of AIA signals to lower chromospheric
layers is shown. Finally, ingoing-ingoing minus outgoing-outgoing phase
differences between various measurement heights are discussed.

Observing the shadow of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion black hole,"  In this paper, the shadows cast by Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion black hole
and naked singularity are studied. The shadow of a rotating black hole is found
to be a dark zone covered by a deformed circle. For a fixed value of the spin
$a$, the size of the shadow decreases with the dilaton parameter $b$. The
distortion of the shadow monotonically increases with $b$ and takes its maximal
when the black hole approaches to the extremal case. Due to the optical
properties, the area of the black hole shadow is supposed to equal to the
high-energy absorption cross section. Based on this assumption, the energy
emission rate is investigated. For a naked singularity, the shadow has a dark
arc and a dark spot or straight, and the corresponding observables are
obtained. These results show that there is a significant effect of the spin $a$
and dilaton parameter $b$ on these shadows. Moreover, we examine the
observables of the shadow cast by the supermassive black hole at the center of
the Milky Way, which is very useful for us to probe the nature of the black
hole through the astronomical observations in the near future.

instantiate it through several popular mobility models. Large scale network
simulation is conducted to verify our analysis.

A Phenomenological Cost Model for High Energy Particle Accelerators,"  Accelerator-based high-energy physics have been in the forefront of
scientific discoveries for more than half a century. The accelerator technology
of the colliders has progressed immensely, while the beam energy, luminosity,
facility size, and cost have grown by several orders of magnitude. The method
of colliding beams has not fully exhausted its potential but has slowed down
considerably in its progress. In this paper we derive a simple scaling model
for the cost of large accelerators and colliding beam facilities based on costs
of 17 big facilities which have been either built or carefully estimated.
Although this approach cannot replace an actual cost estimate based on an
engineering design, this parameterization is to indicate a somewhat realistic
cost range for consideration of what future frontier accelerator facilities
might be fiscally realizable.

Charge Stripes in the Two-Orbital Hubbard Model for Pnictides,"  The two-orbital Hubbard model for the pnictides is studied numerically using
the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation on finite clusters. Upon electron
doping, states with a nonuniform distribution of charge are stabilized. The
observed patterns correspond to charge stripes oriented perpendicular to the
direction of the spin stripes of the undoped magnetic ground state. While these
charge striped states are robust when the undoped state has a Hubbard gap,
their existence when the intermediate-coupling magnetic metallic state of
pnictides is doped was also observed for particular model parameters. Results
for hole doping and implications for recent experiments that reported
electronic nematic states and spin incommensurability are also briefly
discussed.

Shining Flavor and Radion Phenomenology in Warped Extra Dimension,"  We study radion phenomenology in the context of flavor shining in warped
extra dimension models. In this unique setup, originally proposed by Rattazzi
and Zaffaroni, solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and the new physics
flavor problem are unified. A special role is played by the vacuum energy on
the branes, that naturally allows for flavon stabilization and parametrically
raises the radion mass. We note that the radion mass squared is suppressed only
by the log of the weak-Planck hierarchy, and it is in the favored range of the
standard model Higgs. We emphasize that the radion to di-photon, to tau tau and
to WW^* can be promising discovery channels at the LHC, with a rate above that
of the standard model Higgs. We find that the radion is unlikely to account for
the excess in W plus dijet events as recently reported by the CDF
collaboration.

Low-Degree High-Frequency p and g Modes in the Solar Core,"  Solar gravity (g) modes propagate within the radiative part of the solar
interior and are highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the solar core.
They would represent the best tool to infer the structure and dynamics of the
radiative interior, in particular the core, if they were properly detected and
characterized. Although individual rotational splittings for g modes have not
yet been calculated, we have to understand the effect of these modes, and also
low-degree high-frequency p modes, on the inversion of the solar rotation rate
between 0.1 and 0.2 Rs. In this work, we follow the methodology developed in
Mathur et al. (2008) and Garcia et al. (2008), adding g modes and low-degree
high-frequency p modes to artificial inversion data sets, in order to study how
they convey information on the solar core rotation.

"Cohesive energy and structural parameters of binary oxides of groups IIA
  and IIIB from diffusion quantum Monte Carlo","  We have applied the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method to calculate
the cohesive energy and the structural parameters of the binary oxides CaO,
SrO, BaO, Sc2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3. The aim of our calculations is to
systematically quantify the accuracy of the DMC method to study this type of
metal oxides. The DMC results were compared with local, semi-local and hybrid
Density Functional Theory (DFT) approximations as well as with experimental
measurements. The DMC method yields cohesive energies for these oxides with a
mean absolute deviation from experimental measurements of 0.18(2) eV, while
with local, semi-local and hybrid DFT approximations the deviation is 3.06,
0.94 and 1.23 eV, respectively. For lattice constants, the mean absolute
deviation in DMC, local, semi-local and hybrid DFT approximations, are
0.017(1), 0.07, 0.05 and 0.04 {\AA}, respectively. DMC is highly accurate
method, outperforming the DFT approximations in describing the cohesive
energies and structural parameters of these binary oxides.

"Formation and transformation of the 3:1 mean-motion resonance in 55
  Cancri System","  We report in this paper the numerical simulations of the capture into the 3:1
mean-motion resonance between the planet b and c in the 55 Cancri system. The
results show that this resonance can be obtained by a differential planetary
migration. The moderate initial eccentricities, relatively slower migration and
suitable eccentricity damping rate increase significantly the probability of
being trapped in this resonance. Otherwise, the system crosses the 3:1
commensurability avoiding resonance capture, to be eventually captured into a
2:1 resonance or some other higher-order resonances. After the resonance
capture, the system could jump from one orbital configuration to another one if
the migration continues, making a large region of the configuration space
accessible for a resonance system. These investigations help us understand the
diversity of resonance configurations and put some constrains on the early
dynamical evolution of orbits in the extra-solar planetary systems.

Open questions on the impact of an inflated ball,"  The behaviour of sports balls during impact defines some special features of
each sport. The velocity of the game, the accuracy of passes or shots, the
control of the ball direction after impact, the risks of injury, are all set by
the impact mechanics of the ball. For inflated sports balls, those
characteristics are finely tuned by the ball inner pressure. As a consequence,
inflation pressures are regulated for sports played with inflated balls.
Despite a good understanding of ball elasticity, the source of energy
dissipation for inflated balls remains controversial. We first give a clear
view of non-dissipative impact mechanics. Second we review, analyse and
estimate the different sources of energy dissipation of the multi-physics
phenomena that occur during the impact. Finally, we propose several experiments
to decide between gas compression, shell visco-elastic dissipation, solid
friction, sound emission or shell vibrations as the major source of energy
dissipation.

"A Structural and Algorithmic Study of Stable Matching Lattices of
  ""Nearby"" Instances, with Applications","  Recently MV18 identified and initiated work on the new problem of
understanding structural relationships between the lattices of solutions of two
""nearby"" instances of stable matching. They also gave an application of their
work to finding a robust stable matching. However, the types of changes they
allowed in going from instance $A$ to $B$ were very restricted, namely any one
agent executes an upward shift. In this paper, we allow any one agent to
permute its preference list arbitrarily. Let $M_A$ and $M_B$ be the sets of
stable matchings of the resulting pair of instances $A$ and $B$, and let
$\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ be the corresponding lattices of stable
matchings. We prove that the matchings in $M_A \cap M_B$ form a sublattice of
both $\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ and those in $M_A \setminus M_B$ form
a join semi-sublattice of $\mathcal{L}_A$. These properties enable us to obtain
a polynomial time algorithm for not only finding a stable matching in $M_A \cap
M_B$, but also for obtaining the partial order, as promised by Birkhoff's
Representation Theorem, thereby enabling us to generate all matchings in this
sublattice. Our algorithm also helps solve a version of the robust stable
matching problem. We discuss another potential application, namely obtaining
new insights into the incentive compatibility properties of the Gale-Shapley
Deferred Acceptance Algorithm.

"Blasting away a dwarf galaxy: The ""tail"" of ESO 324-G024","  We present Australia Telescope Compact Array radio data of the dwarf
irregular galaxy ESO 324-G024 which is seen in projection against the giant,
northern lobe of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A, NGC 5128). The distorted
morphology and kinematics of ESO 324-G024, as observed in the 21 cm spectral
line emission of neutral hydrogen, indicate disruptions by external forces. We
investigate whether tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping are
responsible for the formation of the HI tail stretching to the northeast of ESO
324-G024 with the latter being most probable. Furthermore, we closely analyze
the sub-structure of Cen A's polarized radio lobes to ascertain whether ESO
324-G024 is located in front, within or behind the northern lobe. Our
multi-wavelength, multi-component approach allows us to determine that ESO
324-G024 is most likely behind the northern radio lobe of Cen A. This result
helps to constrain the orientation of the lobe, which is likely inclined to our
line of sight by approximately 60 degrees if NGC 5128 and ESO 324-G024 are at
the same distance.

A Two-Dimensional Lattice Ion Trap for Quantum Simulation,"  Quantum simulations of spin systems could enable the solution of problems
which otherwise require infeasible classical resources. Such a simulation may
be implemented using a well-controlled system of effective spins, such as a
two-dimensional lattice of locally interacting ions. We propose here a layered
planar rf trap design that can be used to create arbitrary two-dimensional
lattices of ions. The design also leads naturally to ease of microfabrication.
As a first experimental demonstration, we confine strontium-88 ions in a
mm-scale lattice trap and verify numerical models of the trap by measuring the
motional frequencies. We also confine 440 nm diameter charged microspheres and
observe ion-ion repulsion between ions in neighboring lattice sites. Our
design, when scaled to smaller ion-ion distances, is appropriate for quantum
simulation schemes, e.g. that of Porras and Cirac (PRL 92 207901 (2004)). We
note, however, that in practical realizations of the trap, an increase in the
secular frequency with decreasing ion spacing may make a coupling rate that is
large relative to the decoherence rate in such a trap difficult to achieve.

"Velocity, temperature and normal force dependence on friction: An
  analytical and molecular dynamic study","  In this work we propose an extension to the analytical one-dimensional model
proposed by E. Gnecco (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84:1172) to describe friction. Our
model includes normal forces and the dependence with the angular direction of
movement in which the object is dragged over a surface. The presence of the
normal force in the model allow us to define judiciously the friction
coefficient, instead of introducing it as an {\sl a posteriori} concept. We
compare the analytical results with molecular dynamics simulations. The
simulated model corresponds to a tip sliding over a surface. The tip is
simulated as a single particle interacting with a surface through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. The surface is considered as consisting of a
regular BCC(001) arrangement of particles interacting with each other through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. We investigate the system under several
conditions of velocity, temperature and normal forces. Our analytical results
are in very good agreement with those obtained by the simulations and with
experimental results from E. Riedo (Phys. Rev. Lett. 91:084502) and Eui-Sung
Yoon (Wear 259:1424-1431) as well.

Optimizing CMS build infrastructure via Apache Mesos,"  The Offline Software of the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
at CERN consists of 6M lines of in-house code, developed over a decade by
nearly 1000 physicists, as well as a comparable amount of general use
open-source code. A critical ingredient to the success of the construction and
early operation of the WLCG was the convergence, around the year 2000, on the
use of a homogeneous environment of commodity x86-64 processors and Linux.
Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation
and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop,
Jenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other applications on a dynamically shared pool of
nodes. We present how we migrated our continuos integration system to schedule
jobs on a relatively small Apache Mesos enabled cluster and how this resulted
in better resource usage, higher peak performance and lower latency thanks to
the dynamic scheduling capabilities of Mesos.

Plastic flow in solids with interfaces,"  A non-equilibrium theory of isothermal and diffusionless evolution of
incoherent interfaces within a plastically deforming solid is developed. The
irreversible dynamics of the interface are driven by its normal motion,
incoherency (slip and misorientation), and an intrinsic plastic flow; and
purely by plastic deformation in the bulk away from the interface. Using the
continuum theory for defect distribution (in bulk and over the interface) we
formulate a general kinematical framework, derive relevant balance laws and
jump conditions, and prescribe a thermodynamically consistent
constitutive/kinetic structure for interface evolution.

"Measurability Aspects of the Compactness Theorem for Sample Compression
  Schemes","  It was proved in 1998 by Ben-David and Litman that a concept space has a
sample compression scheme of size d if and only if every finite subspace has a
sample compression scheme of size d. In the compactness theorem, measurability
of the hypotheses of the created sample compression scheme is not guaranteed;
at the same time measurability of the hypotheses is a necessary condition for
learnability. In this thesis we discuss when a sample compression scheme,
created from com- pression schemes on finite subspaces via the compactness
theorem, have measurable hypotheses. We show that if X is a standard Borel
space with a d-maximum and universally separable concept class C, then (X,C)
has a sample compression scheme of size d with universally Borel measurable
hypotheses. Additionally we introduce a new variant of compression scheme
called a copy sample compression scheme.

"Serum protein resistant behavior of multisite-bound poly(ethylene
  glycol) chains onto iron oxide surfaces","  Recent surveys have shown that the number of nanoparticle-based formulations
actually used at the clinical level is significantly lower than expected a
decade ago. One reason for this is that the nanoparticle physicochemical
properties fall short for handling the complexity of biological environments
and for preventing nonspecific protein adsorption. In this study, we address
the issue of the interactions of plasma proteins with polymer coated surfaces.
To this aim, we use a non-covalent grafting-to method to functionalize iron
oxide sub-10 nm nanoparticles and iron oxide flat substrates, and compare their
protein responses. The functionalized copolymers consist in alternating
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains and phosphonic acid grafted on the same
backbone. Quartz Crystal Microbalance with dissipation was used to monitor the
polymer adsorption kinetics and to evaluate the resistance to protein
adsorption. On flat substrates, functionalized PEG copolymers adsorb and form a
brush in the moderate or in the highly stretched regimes, with density between
0.15 and 1.5 nm-2. PEG layers using phosphonic acid as linkers exhibit
excellent protein resistance. In contrast, layers prepared with carboxylic acid
as grafting agent exhibit mitigated protein responses and layer
destructuration. The present study establishes a correlation between the
long-term stability of PEG coated particles in biofluids and the protein
resistance of surfaces coated with the same polymers.

"Quantum Information at the Interface of Light with Atomic Ensembles and
  Micromechanical Oscillators","  This article reviews recent research towards a universal light-matter
interface. Such an interface is an important prerequisite for long distance
quantum communication, entanglement assisted sensing and measurement, as well
as for scalable photonic quantum computation. We review the developments in
light-matter interfaces based on room temperature atomic vapors interacting
with propagating pulses via the Faraday effect. This interaction has long been
used as a tool for quantum nondemolition detections of atomic spins via light.
It was discovered recently that this type of light-matter interaction can
actually be tuned to realize more general dynamics, enabling better performance
of the light-matter interface as well as rendering tasks possible, which were
before thought to be impractical. This includes the realization of improved
entanglement assisted and backaction evading magnetometry approaching the
Quantum Cramer-Rao limit, quantum memory for squeezed states of light and the
dissipative generation of entanglement. A separate, but related, experiment on
entanglement assisted cold atom clock showing the Heisenberg scaling of
precision is described. We also review a possible interface between collective
atomic spins with nano- or micromechanical oscillators, providing a link
between atomic and solid state physics approaches towards quantum information
processing.

"Geometry of halo and Lissajous orbits in the circular restricted
  three-body problem with drag forces","  In this paper, we determine the effect of radiation pressure,
Poynting-Robertson drag and solar wind drag on the Sun-(Earth-Moon) restricted
three body problem. Here, we take the larger body of the Sun as a larger
primary, and Earth+Moon as a smaller primary. With the help of the perturbation
technique, we find the Lagrangian points, and see that the collinear points
deviate from the axis joining the primaries, whereas the triangular points
remain unchanged in their configuration. We also find that
  Lagrangian points move towards the Sun when radiation pressure increases. We
have also analysed the stability of the triangular equilibrium points and have
found that they are unstable because of the drag forces. Moreover, we have
computed the halo orbits in the third-order approximation using
Lindstedt-Poincar$\acute{e}$ method and have found the effect of the drag
forces. According to this prevalence, the Sun-(Earth-Moon) model is used to
design the trajectory for spacecraft traveling under the drag forces.

Critical behavior at Mott-Anderson transition: a TMT-DMFT perspective,"  We present a detailed analysis of the critical behavior close to the
Mott-Anderson transition. Our findings are based on a combination of numerical
and analytical results obtained within the framework of Typical-Medium Theory
(TMT-DMFT) - the simplest extension of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)
capable of incorporating Anderson localization effects. By making use of
previous scaling studies of Anderson impurity models close to the
metal-insulator transition, we solve this problem analytically and reveal the
dependence of the critical behavior on the particle-hole symmetry. Our main
result is that, for sufficiently strong disorder, the Mott-Anderson transition
is characterized by a precisely defined two-fluid behavior, in which only a
fraction of the electrons undergo a ""site selective"" Mott localization; the
rest become Anderson-localized quasiparticles.

"Ferrimagnetism and compensation temperature in spin-$1/2$ Ising
  trilayers","  The mean-field and effective-field approximations are applied in the study of
magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-$1/2$ Ising system containing
three layers, each of which is composed exclusively of one out of two possible
types of atoms, \textbf{A} or \textbf{B}. The \textbf{A-A} and \textbf{B-B}
bonds are ferromagnetic while the \textbf{A-B} bonds are antiferromagnetic. The
occurrence of a compensation phenomenon is verified and the compensation and
critical temperatures are obtained as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters.
We present phase diagrams dividing the parameter space in regions where the
compensation phenomenon is present or absent and a detailed discussion about
the influence of each parameter on the overall behavior of the system is made.

Sequentially split $*$-homomorphisms between $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras,"  We define and examine sequentially split $*$-homomorphisms between
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras and $\mathrm{C}^*$-dynamical systems. For a
$*$-homomorphism, the property of being sequentially split can be regarded as
an approximate weakening of being a split-injective inclusion of
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We show for a sequentially split $*$-homomorphism that
a multitude of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic approximation properties pass from the
target algebra to the domain algebra, including virtually all important
approximation properties currently used in the classification theory of
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We also discuss various settings in which sequentially
split $*$-homomorphisms arise naturally from context. One particular class of
examples arises from compact group actions with the Rokhlin property. This
allows us to recover and extend the presently known permanence properties of
Rokhlin actions with a unified conceptual approach and a simple proof.
Moreover, this perspective allows us to obtain new results about such actions,
such as a generalization of Izumi's original $K$-theory formula for the fixed
point algebra, or duality between the Rokhlin property and approximate
representability.

Yang-Mills. Along the way, we determine the structure of the four derivative
interactions for the toroidally compactified (2,0) theory, while encountering
interesting novelties in the structure of the six derivative interactions.

"Convergence of a one dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate
  mobility","  We consider a one dimensional periodic forward-backward parabolic equation,
regularized by a non-linear fourth order term of order $\epsilon^2\ll 1$. This
equation is known in the literature as Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate
mobility. Under the hypothesis of the initial data being well prepared, we
prove that as $\epsilon\to0$, the solution converges to the solution of a
well-posed degenerate parabolic equation. The proof exploits the gradient flow
nature of the equation in $\mathcal{W}^2$ and utilizes the framework of
convergence of gradient flows developed by Sandier-Serfaty. As an incidental,
we study fine energetic properties of solutions to the Thin-film equation
$\partial_t\nu=(\nu\nu_{xxx})_x$.

"Global stabilization of nonlinear systems based on vector control
  lyapunov functions","  This paper studies the use of vector Lyapunov functions for the design of
globally stabilizing feedback laws for nonlinear systems. Recent results on
vector Lyapunov functions are utilized. The main result of the paper shows that
the existence of a vector control Lyapunov function is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of a smooth globally stabilizing
feedback. Applications to nonlinear systems are provided: simple and easily
checkable sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the existence of a
smooth globally stabilizing feedback law. The obtained results are applied to
the problem of the stabilization of an equilibrium point of a reaction network
taking place in a continuous stirred tank reactor.

"Do semidefinite relaxations solve sparse PCA up to the information
  limit?","  Estimating the leading principal components of data, assuming they are
sparse, is a central task in modern high-dimensional statistics. Many
algorithms were developed for this sparse PCA problem, from simple diagonal
thresholding to sophisticated semidefinite programming (SDP) methods. A key
theoretical question is under what conditions can such algorithms recover the
sparse principal components? We study this question for a single-spike model
with an $\ell_0$-sparse eigenvector, in the asymptotic regime as dimension $p$
and sample size $n$ both tend to infinity. Amini and Wainwright [Ann. Statist.
37 (2009) 2877-2921] proved that for sparsity levels $k\geq\Omega(n/\log p)$,
no algorithm, efficient or not, can reliably recover the sparse eigenvector. In
contrast, for $k\leq O(\sqrt{n/\log p})$, diagonal thresholding is consistent.
It was further conjectured that an SDP approach may close this gap between
computational and information limits. We prove that when
$k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, the proposed SDP approach, at least in its standard
usage, cannot recover the sparse spike. In fact, we conjecture that in the
single-spike model, no computationally-efficient algorithm can recover a spike
of $\ell_0$-sparsity $k\geq\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we present empirical
results suggesting that up to sparsity levels $k=O(\sqrt{n})$, recovery is
possible by a simple covariance thresholding algorithm.

An X-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4Ms CDFS observations,"  [Abridged] We use the large public spectroscopic database available in the
GOODS-South field to estimate the dynamical mass and the virialization status
of cluster ClG 0332-2747 at z=0.734. Cluster members selected from their
photometric redshift are used with spectroscopic ones to analyse the galaxy
population of the cluster. In the newly released Chandra 4Ms observations we
detect a faint extended X-ray emission associated to the cluster. Finally, we
compare the optical and X-ray properties of ClG 0332-2747 with the predictions
of a well tested semianalytic model. We estimate the velocity dispersion and
the virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequence
members only. We obtain sigma_v=634 +/- 105 Km/s, M_200=3.07
^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} M_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values in
the latter case. The cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: it
shows a perfectly Gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence for
substructures. ClG 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,
and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} M_sun) old brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. We detect a faint
extended X-ray source centered on the BCG, with a total X-ray luminosity of L_X
~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 keV). This L_X is lower by a factor of ~10-20
than expected according to the M-L_X relation. We provide a possible
explanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of AGN feedback on the
ICM: the semianalytic model reproduces the M-L_X relation measured from ""X-ray
bright"" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heating
and expulsion of the cluster gas. Interestingly, in the model clusters with an
evolved galaxy population like ClG 0332-2747 present the largest scatter in
X-ray luminosity.

"Enhancing quantum control by bootstrapping a quantum processor of 12
  qubits","  Accurate and efficient control of quantum systems is one of the central
challenges for quantum information processing. Current state-of-the-art
experiments rarely go beyond 10 qubits and in most cases demonstrate only
limited control. Here we demonstrate control of a 12-qubit system, and show
that the system can be employed as a quantum processor to optimize its own
control sequence by using measurement-based feedback control (MQFC). The final
product is a control sequence for a complex 12-qubit task: preparation of a
12-coherent state. The control sequence is about 10% more accurate than the one
generated by the standard (classical) technique, showing that MQFC can correct
for unknown imperfections. Apart from demonstrating a high level of control
over a relatively large system, our results show that even at the 12-qubit
level, a quantum processor can be a useful lab instrument. As an extension of
our work, we propose a method for combining the MQFC technique with a twirling
protocol, to optimize the control sequence that produces a desired Clifford
gate.

Blockchain Enabled Enhanced IoT Ecosystem Security,"  Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, is
starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the
Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused
in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof of Work (PoW), a
cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining
a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible.
Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of
users, thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in cryptocurrency has
the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted
non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof of
location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects or applications
were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and
identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced
security for the IoT ecosystem.

"A Study on Unsupervised Dictionary Learning and Feature Encoding for
  Action Classification","  Many efforts have been devoted to develop alternative methods to traditional
vector quantization in image domain such as sparse coding and soft-assignment.
These approaches can be split into a dictionary learning phase and a feature
encoding phase which are often closely connected. In this paper, we investigate
the effects of these phases by separating them for video-based action
classification. We compare several dictionary learning methods and feature
encoding schemes through extensive experiments on KTH and HMDB51 datasets.
Experimental results indicate that sparse coding performs consistently better
than the other encoding methods in large complex dataset (i.e., HMDB51), and it
is robust to different dictionaries. For small simple dataset (i.e., KTH) with
less variation, however, all the encoding strategies perform competitively. In
addition, we note that the strength of sophisticated encoding approaches comes
not from their corresponding dictionaries but the encoding mechanisms, and we
can just use randomly selected exemplars as dictionaries for video-based action
classification.

Characteristics of transverse waves in chromospheric mottles,"  Using data obtained by the high temporal and spatial resolution Rapid
Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument on the Dunn Solar
Telescope, we investigate at an unprecedented level of detail transverse
oscillations in chromospheric fine structures near the solar disk center. The
oscillations are interpreted in terms of propagating and standing
magnetohydrodynamic kink waves. Wave characteristics including the maximum
transverse velocity amplitude and the phase speed are measured as a function of
distance along the structure's length. Solar magneto-seismology is applied to
these measured parameters to obtain diagnostic information on key plasma
parameters (e.g., magnetic field, density, temperature, flow speed) of these
localised waveguides. The magnetic field strength of the mottle along the
$\sim$2 Mm length is found to decrease by a factor of 12, while the local
plasma density scale height is $\sim280\pm$80 km.

"Interior Models of Saturn: Including the Uncertainties in Shape and
  Rotation","  The accurate determination of Saturn's gravitational coefficients by Cassini
could provide tighter constrains on Saturn's internal structure. Also,
occultation measurements provide important information on the planetary shape
which is often not considered in structure models. In this paper we explore how
wind velocities and internal rotation affect the planetary shape and the
constraints on Saturn's interior. We show that within the geodetic approach
(Lindal et al., 1985, ApJ, 90, 1136) the derived physical shape is insensitive
to the assumed deep rotation. Saturn's re-derived equatorial and polar radii at
100 mbar are found to be 54,445 $\pm$10 km and 60,365$\pm$10 km, respectively.
To determine Saturn's interior we use {\it 1 D} three-layer hydrostatic
structure models, and present two approaches to include the constraints on the
shape. These approaches, however, result in only small differences in Saturn's
derived composition. The uncertainty in Saturn's rotation period is more
significant: with Voyager's 10h39mns period, the derived mass of heavy elements
in the envelope is 0-7 M$_{\oplus}$. With a rotation period of 10h32mns, this
value becomes $<4$ $M_{\oplus}$, below the minimum mass inferred from
spectroscopic measurements. Saturn's core mass is found to depend strongly on
the pressure at which helium phase separation occurs, and is estimated to be
5-20 M$_{\oplus}$. Lower core masses are possible if the separation occurs
deeper than 4 Mbars. We suggest that the analysis of Cassini's radio
occultation measurements is crucial to test shape models and could lead to
constraints on Saturn's rotation profile and departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium.

during the propagation. When the wave packets are relatively wide or their
power is relatively high, they can experience self-narrowing or even evolve
into bright solitons. The experimental results were reproduced by numerical
simulations based on a modified nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation model.

Landau damping in a collisionless dipolar Bose gas,"  We present a theory for the Landau damping of low energy quasi-particles in a
collisionless, quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas and produce expressions for the
damping rate in uniform and non-uniform systems. Using simple energy-momentum
conservation arguments, we show that in the homogeneous system, the nature of
the low energy dispersion in a dipolar Bose gas severely inhibits Landau
damping of long wave-length excitations. For a gas with contact and dipolar
interactions, the damping rate for phonons tends to decrease with increasing
dipolar interactions; for strong dipole-dipole interactions, phonons are
virtually undamped over a broad range of temperature. The damping rate for
maxon-roton excitations is found to be significantly larger than the damping
rate for phonons.

A condensed matter analogy of impact crater formation,"  Impact craters exist on various solid objects in the planetary system. A
simplified analogy of the process of their formation is here analyzed by
standard solid state physics and the so called dynamic quantized fracture
mechanics. An expression which links the crater volume to the parameters of the
impactor and the target is obtained within the two approaches. For low impactor
energy, this expression is of the same mathematical form as the one resulting
from recent experiments.It is shown that the formation of an impact crater is
possible even without heating of the target, if the critical stress in the
target satisfies certain conditions. The critical value of the stress needed
for the occurence of a fracture is calculated for three craters: two
terrestrial and one lunar crater. The approach presented here uses only
measurable material parameters, and is therefore more realistic than the
treatement of the same problem using the cohesive energy of materials.

"A state of the art of urban reconstruction: street, street network,
  vegetation, urban feature","  World population is raising, especially the part of people living in cities.
With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and
their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and
analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally,
much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential
part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom
researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a
unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing
the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by
considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for
city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse
which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street
reconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features
reconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects
reconstruction/modelling.
  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role
the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse
procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to
come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of
the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and
to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural
modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the
reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.

Tachyon Vacuum in Cubic Superstring Field Theory,"  In this paper we give an exact analytic solution for tachyon condensation in
the modified (picture 0) cubic superstring field theory. We prove the absence
of cohomology and, crucially, reproduce the correct value for the D-brane
tension. The solution is surprising for two reasons: First, the existence of a
tachyon vacuum in this theory has not been definitively established in the

"Self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flows on Riemannian cone
  manifolds and special Lagrangians on toric Calabi-Yau cones","  The self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flows have been defined and
studied on the Euclidean space. In this paper we initiate a general treatment

manifolds. As a typical result we extend the well-known result of Huisken about
the asymptotic behavior for the singularities of the mean curvature flows. We
also extend the results on special Lagrangian submanifolds on $\mathbb C^n$ to
the toric Calabi-Yau cones over Sasaki-Einstein manifolds.

"Functional renormalization group study of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model
  at finite temperature and density in an external magnetic field","  In this study, we investigate the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite
temperature and finite density in an external magnetic field using the
functional renormalization group. We investigate the dependence of the position
of the ultraviolet fixed point (UVFP) of the four-Fermi coupling constant on
the temperature, density, and external magnetic field, and we obtain the chiral
phase structure. The UVFP at low temperature and finite chemical potential
oscillates in a small external magnetic field, which can be interpreted as the
de Haas--van Alphen effect. We also obtain phase diagrams with complex
structures, where the phase boundary moves back and forth as the external
magnetic field increases in the low temperature and high density region.

"Geometric Intersection Number and analogues of the Curve Complex for

Bonahon-type continuous and $Out(F_N)$-invariant \emph{geometric intersection
form} \[ <, >: \bar{cv}(F_N)\times Curr(F_N)\to \mathbb R_{\ge 0}. \]
  Here $\bar{cv}(F_N)$ is the closure of unprojectivized Culler-Vogtmann's
Outer space $cv(F_N)$ in the equivariant Gromov-Hausdorff convergence topology
(or, equivalently, in the length function topology). It is known that
$\bar{cv}(F_N)$ consists of all \emph{very small} minimal isometric actions of
$F_N$ on $\mathbb R$-trees. The projectivization of $\bar{cv}(F_N)$ provides a
free group analogue of Thurston's compactification of the Teichm\""uller space.
  As an application, using the \emph{intersection graph} determined by the
intersection form, we show that several natural analogues of the curve complex
in the free group context have infinite diameter.

"Flow organization in non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq Rayleigh-Benard convection
  in water","  Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects on the flow organization in
two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard turbulence are numerically analyzed. The
working fluid is water. We focus on the temperature profiles, the center
temperature, the Nusselt number, and on the analysis of the velocity field.
Several velocity amplitudes (or Reynolds numbers) and several kinetic profiles
are introduced and studied; these together describe the various features of the
rather complex flow organization. The results are presented both as functions
of the Rayleigh number Ra (with Ra up to 10^8) for fixed temperature difference
(Delta) between top and bottom plates and as functions of Delta
(""non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness"") for fixed Ra with Delta up to 60 K. All results
are consistent with the available experimental NOB data for the center
temperature Tc and the Nusselt number ratio Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB} (the label OB
meaning that the Oberbeck-Boussinesq conditions are valid).
  Beyond Ra ~ 10^6 the flow consists of a large diagonal center convection roll
and two smaller rolls in the upper and lower corners. In the NOB case the
center convection roll is still characterized by only one velocity scale.

Proofs of two conjectures on generalized Fibonacci cubes,"  A binary string $f$ is a factor of string $u$ if $f$ appears as a sequence of
$|f|$ consecutive bits of $u$, where $|f|$ denotes the length of $f$.
Generalized Fibonacci cube $Q_{d}(f)$ is the graph obtained from the $d$-cube
$Q_{d}$ by removing all vertices that contain a given binary string $f$ as a
factor. A binary string $f$ is called good if $Q_{d}(f)$ is an isometric
subgraph of $Q_{d}$ for all $d\geq1$, it is called bad otherwise. The index of
a binary string $f$, denoted by $B(f)$, is the smallest integer $d$ such that
$Q_{d}(f)$ is not an isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$. Ili\'{c}, Klav\v{z}ar and
Rho conjectured that $B(f)<2|f|$ for any bad string $f$. They also conjectured
that if $Q_{d}(f)$ is an isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$, then $Q_{d}(ff)$ is an
isometric subgraph of $Q_{d}$. We confirm the two conjectures by obtaining a
basic result: if there exist $p$-critical words for $Q_{B(f)}(f)$, then $p$=2
or $p=3$.

"Creation and protection of entanglement in systems out of thermal
  equilibrium","  We investigate the creation of entanglement between two quantum emitters
interacting with a realistic common stationary electromagnetic field out of
thermal equilibrium. In the case of two qubits we show that the absence of
equilibrium allows the generation of steady entangled states, which is
inaccessible at thermal equilibrium and is realized without any further
external action on the two qubits. We first give a simple physical
interpretation of the phenomenon in a specific case and then we report a
detailed investigation on the dependence of the entanglement dynamics on the
various physical parameters involved. Sub- and super-radiant effects are
discussed, and qualitative differences in the dynamics concerning both creation
and protection of entanglement according to the initial two-qubit state are
pointed out.

"On Supersymmetric Geometric Flows and $\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation From
  Scale Invariant Supergravity","  Models of geometric flows pertaining to $\mathcal{R}^2$ scale invariant
(super) gravity theories coupled to conformally invariant matter fields are
investigated. Related to this work are supersymmetric scalar manifolds that are
isomorphic to the K\""{a}hlerian spaces $\mathcal{M}_n=SU(1,1+k)/U(1)\times
SU(1+k)$ as generalizations of the non-supersymmetric analogs with
$SO(1,1+k)/SO(1+k)$ manifolds. For curved superspaces with geometric evolution
of physical objects, a complete supersymmetric theory has to be elaborated on
nonholonomic (super) manifolds and bundles determined by non-integrable
superdistributions with additional constraints on (super) field dynamics and
geometric evolution equations. We also consider generalizations of Perelman's
functionals using such nonholonomic variables which result in the decoupling of
geometric flow equations and Ricci soliton equations with supergravity
modifications of the $R^2$ gravity theory. As such, it is possible to construct
exact non-homogeneous and locally anisotropic cosmological solutions for
various types of (super) gravity theories modelled as modified Ricci soliton
configurations. Such solutions are defined by employing the general ansatz
encompassing coefficients of generic off-diagonal metrics and generalized
connections that depend generically on all spacetime coordinates. We consider
nonholonomic constraints resulting in diagonal homogeneous configurations
encoding contributions from possible nonlinear parametric geometric evolution
scenarios, off-diagonal interactions and anisotropic polarization/ modification
of physical constants. We also analyze the conditions under which such modified
mimetic type theories and solutions reproduce the Starobinsky inflationary
models in the double scalar approach.

Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"  Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent
years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose
significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a
general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training
environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in
downstream tasks. Our approach brings together some of the strengths of
intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is
guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal
domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is
trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the
exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To
efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks
combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that
this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills
in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance
uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.

"An introduction to moduli stacks, with a view towards Higgs bundles on
  algebraic curves","  This article is based in part on lecture notes prepared for the summer school
""The Geometry, Topology and Physics of Moduli Spaces of Higgs Bundles"" at the
Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the National University of Singapore in
July of 2014. The aim is to provide a brief introduction to algebraic stacks,
and then to give several constructions of the moduli stack of Higgs bundles on
algebraic curves. The first construction is via a ""bootstrap"" method from the
algebraic stack of vector bundles on an algebraic curve. This construction is
motivated in part by Nitsure's GIT construction of a projective moduli space of
semi-stable Higgs bundles, and we describe the relationship between Nitsure's
moduli space and the algebraic stacks constructed here. The third approach is
via deformation theory, where we directly construct the stack of Higgs bundles
using Artin's criterion.

Light-Cone Coordinate System in General Relativity,"  If there is a null gradient field in 1+3 dimensional space-time, we can set
up a kind of light-cone coordinate system in the space-time. In such coordinate
system, the metric takes a simple form, which is much helpful for simplifying
and solving the Einstein's field equation. This light-cone coordinate system
has wonderful properties and has been widely used in astrophysics to calculate
parameters. In this paper, we give a detailed discussion for the structure of
space-time with light-cone coordinate system. We derive the conditions for
existence of such coordinate system, and show how to construct the light-cone
coordinate system from usual ones, then explain their geometrical and physical
meanings by examples.

"Iterative graph cuts for image segmentation with a nonlinear statistical
  shape prior","  Shape-based regularization has proven to be a useful method for delineating
objects within noisy images where one has prior knowledge of the shape of the
targeted object. When a collection of possible shapes is available, the
specification of a shape prior using kernel density estimation is a natural
technique. Unfortunately, energy functionals arising from kernel density
estimation are of a form that makes them impossible to directly minimize using
efficient optimization algorithms such as graph cuts. Our main contribution is
to show how one may recast the energy functional into a form that is
minimizable iteratively and efficiently using graph cuts.

Gradient Clock Synchronization using Reference Broadcasts,"  In this paper we suggest a method by which reference broadcast
synchronization (RBS), and other methods of estimating clock values, can be
incorporated in standard clock synchronization algorithms to improve
synchronization quality. We advocate a logical separation of the task of
estimating the clock values of other nodes in the network from the task of
using these estimates to output a logical clock value.
  The separation is achieved by means of a virtual estimate graph, overlaid on
top of the real network graph, which represents the information various nodes
can obtain about each other. RBS estimates are represented in the estimate
graph as edges between nodes at distance 2 from each other in the original
network graph. A clock synchronization algorithm then operates on the estimate
graph as though it were the original network.
  To illustrate the merits of this approach, we modify a recent optimal
gradient clock synchronization algorithm to work in this setting. The modified
algorithm transparently takes advantage of RBS estimates and any other means by
which nodes can estimate each others' clock values.

"Performance of the CMS Tracker Optical Links and Future Upgrade Using
  Bandwidth Efficient Digital Modulation","  (Abridged version) The CMS experiment at the LHC will begin operation in
2007. The CMS Tracker sub-detector, comprises ~10 million detector channels
read out by ~40 000 analog optical links. The optoelectronic components have
been designed to meet the stringent requirements of a HEP experiment in terms
of radiation hardness, low mass and low power. Extensive testing has been
performed on the components and on complete optical links in test systems.
Their functionality and performance in terms of gain, noise, linearity,
bandwidth and radiation hardness is detailed. Particular emphasis is placed on
the gain, which directly affects the dynamic range of the detector data. It has
been possible to accurately predict the variation in gain that will be observed
throughout the system. A simulation based on production test data showed that
the average gain would be ~38% higher than the design target at the Tracker
operating temperature of -10{\deg}C. Corrective action was taken to reduce the
gains and recover the lost dynamic range by lowering the optical receiver's
load resistor value from 100{\Omega} to 62{\Omega}. All links will have gains
between 0.64 and 0.96V/V. The future iteration of CMS will be operated in an
upgraded LHC requiring faster data readout. In order to preserve the large
investments made for the current readout system, an upgrade path that involves
reusing the existing optoelectronic components is considered. The applicability
of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in a HEP readout system is examined.
The method for calculating the data rate is presented, along with laboratory
tests where QAM signals were transmitted over a Tracker optical link. The
results show that 3-4Gbit/s would be possible if such a design can be
implemented (over 10 times the equivalent data rate of the current analog
links, 320Mbits/s).

Multifractality and scale invariance in human heartbeat dynamics,"  Human heart rate is known to display complex fluctuations. Evidence of
multifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported
[Ivanov et al., Nature {\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character
could be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability
density functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale
invariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart
rate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In
this paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance
reported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy
heartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating
that the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent.
Our work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of

Skyrmion Burst and Multiple Quantum Walk in Thin Ferromagnetic Films,"  A giant Skyrmion collapses to a singular point by emitting spin waves in a
thin ferromagnetic film, when external magnetic field is increased beyond the
critical one. The remnant is a single-spin flipped (SSF) point. The SSF point
has a quantum diffusion dynamics governed by the Heisenberg model. We determine
its time evolution and show the diffusion process is a continuous-time quantum
walk. We also analyze an interference of two SSF points after two Skyrmion
bursts. Quantum walks for $S=1/2$ and 1 are exact solvable. The system presents
a new type of quantum walk for $S>1/2$, where a SSF point breaks into 2S
quantum walkers. It is interesting that we can create quantum walkers
experimentally at any points in a magnetic thin film, first by creating
Skyrmions sequentially and then by letting them collapse simultaneously.

"3D Integral Field Observations of Ten Galactic Winds - I. Extended phase
  (>10 Myr) of mass/energy injection before the wind blows","  We present 3D spectroscopic observations of a sample of 10 nearby galaxies
with the AAOmega-SPIRAL integral field spectrograph on the 3.9m AAT, the
largest survey of its kind to date. The double-beam spectrograph provides
spatial maps in a range of spectral diagnostics: [OIII] 5007, H-beta, Mg-b,
NaD, [OI] 6300, H-alpha, [NII] 6583, [SII] 6717, 6731. All of the objects in
our survey show extensive wind-driven filamentation along the minor axis, in
addition to large-scale disk rotation. Our sample can be divided into either
starburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN), although some objects
appear to be a combination of these. The total ionizing photon budget available
to both classes of galaxies is sufficient to ionise all of the wind-blown
filamentation out to large radius. We find however that while AGN
photoionisation always dominates in the wind filaments, this is not the case in
starburst galaxies where shock ionisation dominates. This clearly indicates
that after the onset of star formation, there is a substantial delay (> 10 Myr)
before a starburst wind develops. We show why this behavior is expected by
deriving ``ionisation'' and dynamical timescales for both AGNs and starbursts.
We establish a sequence of events that lead to the onset of a galactic wind.
The clear signature provided by the ionisation timescale is arguably the
strongest evidence yet that the starburst phenomenon is an impulsive event. A
well-defined ionisation timescale is not expected in galaxies with a protracted
history of circumnuclear star formation. Our 3D data provide important
templates for comparisons with high redshift galaxies.[Abridged]

Dark Moments and the DAMA-CoGeNT Puzzle,"  We consider the velocity dependence arising from scattering through dark
multipole moments, and its effects on the consistency of the signals observed
by DAMA and CoGeNT with the dark matter hypothesis. We focus on the effects of
the experimental uncertainties on the fits, and show that the two experiments
combined favor dark matter scattering with a velocity-dependent cross-section
over standard velocity and spin-independent scattering. When appropriate
uncertainties are taken into account, we show that agreement of the two signals
with each other and with the results of null experiments can be obtained.

Adaptive optics in high-contrast imaging,"  The development of adaptive optics (AO) played a major role in modern
astronomy over the last three decades. By compensating for the atmospheric
turbulence, these systems enable to reach the diffraction limit on large
telescopes. In this review, we will focus on high contrast applications of
adaptive optics, namely, imaging the close vicinity of bright stellar objects
and revealing regions otherwise hidden within the turbulent halo of the
atmosphere to look for objects with a contrast ratio lower than 10^-4 with
respect to the central star. Such high-contrast AO-corrected observations have
led to fundamental results in our current understanding of planetary formation
and evolution as well as stellar evolution. AO systems equipped three
generations of instruments, from the first pioneering experiments in the
nineties, to the first wave of instruments on 8m-class telescopes in the years
2000, and finally to the extreme AO systems that have recently started
operations. Along with high-contrast techniques, AO enables to reveal the
circumstellar environment: massive protoplanetary disks featuring spiral arms,
gaps or other asymmetries hinting at on-going planet formation, young giant
planets shining in thermal emission, or tenuous debris disks and micron-sized
dust leftover from collisions in massive asteroid-belt analogs. After
introducing the science case and technical requirements, we will review the
architecture of standard and extreme AO systems, before presenting a few
selected science highlights obtained with recent AO instruments.

aiming to extend Buchsbaum and Eisenbud's famous result in codimension 3. The
main result is a structure theorem stating that the ideal is determined by its
(k+1) x 2k matrix of first syzygies, viewed as a morphism from the ambient
regular space to the Spin-Hom variety SpH_k in Mat(k+1,2k). This is a general
result encapsulating some theoretical aspects of the problem, but, as it
stands, is still some way from tractable applications.

Tools and Procedures for the CTA Array Calibration,"  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an international initiative to build
the next generation ground-based very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory. Full
sky coverage will be assured by two arrays, one located on each of the northern
and southern hemispheres. Three different sizes of telescopes will cover a wide
energy range from tens of GeV up to hundreds of TeV. These telescopes, of which
prototypes are currently under construction or completion, will have different
mirror sizes and fields-of-view designed to access different energy regimes.
Additionally, there will be groups of telescopes with different optics system,
camera and electronics design. Given this diversity of instruments, an overall
coherent calibration of the full array is a challenging task. Moreover, the CTA
requirements on calibration accuracy are much more stringent than those
achieved with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, like for
instance: the systematic errors in the energy scale must not exceed 10%.In this
contribution we present both the methods that, applied directly to the acquired
observational CTA data, will ensure that the calibration is correctly performed
to the stringent required precision, and the calibration equipment that,
external to the telescopes, is currently under development and testing.
Moreover, some notes about the operative procedure to be followed with both
methods and instruments, will be described. The methods applied to the
observational CTA data include the analysis of muon ring images, of carefully
selected cosmic-ray air shower images, of the reconstructed electron spectrum
and that of known gamma-ray sources and the possible use of stereo techniques
hardware-independent. These methods will be complemented with the use of
calibrated light sources located on ground or on board unmanned aerial
vehicles.

"Maximal intensity higher-order Akhmediev breathers of the nonlinear
  Schrodinger equation and their systematic generation","  It is well known that Akhmediev breathers of the nonlinear cubic Schrodinger
equation can be superposed nonlinearly via the Darboux transformation to yield
breathers of higher order. Surprisingly, we find that the peak height of each
Akhmediev breather only adds {\it linearly} to form the peak height of the
final breather. Using this new peak-height formula, we show that at any given
periodicity, there exist a unique high-order breather of maximal intensity.
Moreover, these high-order breathers form a continuous hierarchy, growing in
intensity with increasing periodicity. For any such higher-order breather, a
simple initial wave function can be extracted from the Darboux transformation
to dynamically generate that breather from the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

"General formulation of Luria-Delbr{\""u}ck distribution of the number of
  mutants","  The Luria-Delbr{\""u}ck experiment is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory,
demonstrating the randomness of mutations before selection. The distribution of
the number of mutants in this experiment has been the subject of intense
investigation during the last 70 years. Despite this considerable effort, most
of the results have been obtained under the assumption of constant growth rate,
which is far from the experimental condition. We derive here the properties of
this distribution for arbitrary growth function, for both the deterministic and
stochastic growth of the mutants. The derivation we propose uses the number of
wild type bacteria as the independent variable instead of time. The derivation
is surprisingly simple and versatile, allowing many generalizations to be taken
easily into account.

"A Comprehensive Model to achieve Service Reusability for Multi level
  stakeholders using Non-Functional attributes of Service Oriented Architecture","  SOA is a prominent paradigm for accomplishing reuse of services. Service
reusability is one dominant factor which has a greater influence on achieving
quality in SOA systems. There exists sufficient research in this area and

Few authors have addressed reusability factor with limited non-functional

which have major or greater influence towards obtaining reusability in SOA
systems. The objective of this study goes into the next level, to categorize
the non-functional attributes on multi stakeholder's perspective i.e. Service
Consumer, Service Provider and Service Developer which paves the way to build a

"Sizes of transition-region structures in coronal holes and in the quiet
  Sun","  We study the height variations of the sizes of chromospheric and
transition-region features in a small coronal hole and the adjacent quiet Sun,
considering images of the intensity, Doppler shift, and non-thermal motion of
ultraviolet emission lines as measured by SUMER, together with the magnetic
field as obtained by extrapolation from photospheric magnetograms. In order to
estimate the characteristic sizes of the different features present in the
chromosphere and transition region, we have calculated the autocorrelation
function for the images as well as the corresponding extrapolated magnetic
field at different heights. The HWHM of the autocorrelation function is
considered to be the characteristic size of the feature shown in the
corresponding image. Our results indicate that, in both the coronal hole and
quiet Sun, the HWHM of the intensity image is larger than that of the images of
Doppler-shift and non-thermal width at any given altitude. The HWHM of the
intensity image is smaller in the chromosphere than in the TR, where the sizes
of intensity features of lines at different temperatures are almost the same.
But in the upper part of the transition region, the intensity size increases
more strongly with temperature in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun. We
also studied the height variations of the HWHM of the magnetic field magnitude
B and its component |Bz|, and found they are equal to each other at a certain
height below 40 Mm in the coronal hole. The height variations of the HWHM of
|Bz/B| seem to be consistent with the temperature variations of the intensity
size. Our results suggest that coronal loops are much lower, and magnetic
structures expand through the upper TR and lower corona much more strongly with
height in the coronal hole than in the quiet Sun.

"Entropy Flattening, Gas Clumping and Turbulence in Galaxy Clusters","  Several physical processes and formation events are expected in cluster
outskirts, a vast region up to now essentially not covered by observations. The
recent Suzaku (X-ray) and Planck (Sunayev-Zeldovich effect) observations out to
the virial radius have highlighted in these peripheral regions a rather sharp
decline of the intracluster gas temperature, an entropy flattening in contrast
with the theoretically expected power law increase, the break of the
hydrostatic equilibrium even in some relaxed clusters, a derived gas mass
fraction above the cosmic value measured from several CMB experiments, and a
total X-ray mass lower than the weak lensing mass determinations. Here we
present the analysis of four clusters (A1795, A2029, A2204 and A133) with the
SuperModel that includes a nonthermal pressure component due to turbulence to
sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium also in the cluster outskirts. In such way
we obtain a correct determination of the total X-ray mass and of the gas mass
fraction; this in turn allows to determine the level of the gas clumping that
can affect the shape of the entropy profiles reported by the Suzaku
observations. Our conclusion is that the role of the gas clumping is very
marginal and that the observed entropy flattening is due to the rapid decrement
of the temperature in the cluster outskirts caused by non gravitational
effects. Moreover, we show that the X-ray/SZ joint analysis from ROSAT and
Planck data, as performed in some recent investigations, is inadequate to
discriminate between a power law increase and a flattening of the entropy.

"The Vlasov model under large magnetic fields in the low-Mach number
  regime","  This article is concerned with the kinetic modeling, by means of the Vlasov
equation, of charged particles under the influence of a strong external
electromagnetic field, i.e. when epsilon^2, the dimensionless cyclotron period,
tends to zero. This leads us to split the velocity variable in the Vlasov
equation into fluid and random components. The latter is supposed to have a
large magnitude of order 1/epsilon (which corresponds to the low Mach number
regime). In the limit epsilon -> 0, the resulting model is a hybrid model which
couples a kinetic description of the microscopic random motion of the particles
to a fluid description of the macroscopic behavior of the plasma. The
microscopic model is a first-order partial differential system for the
distribution function, which is averaged over the ultra-fast Larmor gyration
and the fast parallel motion along the magnetic field lines. The perpendicular
component (with respect to the magnetic field lines) of the bulk velocity is
governed by the classical relations describing the E X B and diamagnetic
drifts, while its parallel component satisfies an elliptic equation along the
magnetic field lines.

Closed-loop control of a reaction-diffusion system,"  A system of a parabolic partial differential equation coupled with ordinary

domain basing on the process dynamics observed at a finite number of

Kakutani fixed point theorem.

"Relating Transverse Momentum Dependent and Collinear Factorization
  Theorems in a Generalized Formalism","  We construct an improved implementation for combining
transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization and collinear factorization.
TMD factorization is suitable for low transverse momentum physics, while
collinear factorization is suitable for high transverse momenta and for a cross
section integrated over transverse momentum. The result is a modified version
of the standard $W+Y$ prescription traditionally used in the
Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism and related approaches. We further argue
that questions regarding the shape and $Q$-dependence of the cross sections at
lower $Q$ are largely governed by the matching to the $Y$-term.

Naive model from 1970th applied to CMR manganites: it seems to work,"  Existing experimental data for various colossal magnetoresistance manganites
have been examined employing an ovesimplified model that roots in 1970th. This
model considers a classical semiconductor where conducting bands are affected
by the strong Weiss exchange field that arises from the magnetic order in the
substance. The field--caused shifts of the conducting bands results in the
change in the number of thermally activated carriers, and this change is
presumed to be responsible for the resistivity dependences on temperature and
magnetic field and for the CMR itself. Employing this model we calculate this
hypothetical Weiss field from the experimental data for various CMR manganites
employing minimal set of the adjustable parameters, namely two. The obtained
Weiss field behaves with temperature and external field similarly to the local
magnetization, its supposed source, hence supporting the model.

photons from an atomic collective spin excitation (CSE). The photon arrival

The present experiment uses a diamond scheme with near-IR photons that can be
extended to include telecommunications-wavelengths or modified to allow storage

inconsistencies in the extracted value for alpha_s(M_Z) and the gluon
distribution at higher orders in QCD. The implications for predictions of rates
for Standard Model Higgs boson production at hadron colliders are investigated.
We conclude that the current range of excluded Higgs boson masses at the
Tevatron appears to be much too large.

Deep Diving into BitTorrent Locality,"  A substantial amount of work has recently gone into localizing BitTorrent
traffic within an ISP in order to avoid excessive and often times unnecessary
transit costs. Several architectures and systems have been proposed and the
initial results from specific ISPs and a few torrents have been encouraging. In
this work we attempt to deepen and scale our understanding of locality and its
potential. Looking at specific ISPs, we consider tens of thousands of
concurrent torrents, and thus capture ISP-wide implications that cannot be
appreciated by looking at only a handful of torrents. Secondly, we go beyond
individual case studies and present results for the top 100 ISPs in terms of
number of users represented in our dataset of up to 40K torrents involving more
than 3.9M concurrent peers and more than 20M in the course of a day spread in
11K ASes. We develop scalable methodologies that permit us to process this huge
dataset and answer questions such as: ""\emph{what is the minimum and the
maximum transit traffic reduction across hundreds of ISPs?}"", ""\emph{what are
the win-win boundaries for ISPs and their users?}"", ""\emph{what is the maximum
amount of transit traffic that can be localized without requiring fine-grained
control of inter-AS overlay connections?}"", ""\emph{what is the impact to
transit traffic from upgrades of residential broadband speeds?}"".

"Faraday Rotation in Global Accretion Disk Simulations: Implications for
  Sgr A*","  These Faraday rotation calculations of hot, thick accretion flows are
motivated by the measured steady rotation measure (RM) of $\approx -6 \times
10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A*. In our numerical simulations, the quasi-steady
state structure of the accretion flow, and the RM it produces, depends on the
initial magnetic field. In spite of this dependence, we can draw several robust
conclusions about Faraday rotation produced by geometrically thick accretion
disks: i) the time averaged RM does not depend that sensitively on the viewing
angle, but the stability of the RM can. Equatorial viewing angles show
significant variability in RM (including sign reversals), while polar viewing
angles are relatively stable if there is a large scale magnetic field threading
the disk at large radii. ii) Most of the RM is produced at small radii for
polar viewing angles while all radii contribute significantly near the midplane
of the disk. Our simulations confirm previous analytic arguments that the
accretion rate onto Sgr A* must satisfy $\dot M_{\rm in} \ll \dot M_{\rm Bondi}
\sim 10^{-5} \mpy$ in order to not over-produce the measured RM. We argue that
the steady RM $\approx -6 \times 10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A* has two
plausible explanations: 1) it is produced at $\sim 100$ Schwarzschild radii,
requires $\dot{M}_{\rm in} \approx 3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and we
view the flow at an angle of $\sim 30^\circ$ relative to the rotation axis of
the disk; in our simulations, the variation in RM across a finite-sized source
is sufficient to depolarize the emission below $\approx$ 100 GHz, consistent
with observations. 2) Alternatively, the RM may be produced in the relatively
spherical inflowing plasma near the circularization radius at $\sim 10^3-10^4$
Schwarzschild radii.

"Distributed Relay Protocol for Probabilistic Information-Theoretic
  Security in a Randomly-Compromised Network","  We introduce a simple, practical approach with probabilistic
information-theoretic security to mitigate one of quantum key distribution's
major limitations: the short maximum transmission distance (~200 km) possible
with present day technology. Our scheme uses classical secret sharing
techniques to allow secure transmission over long distances through a network
containing randomly-distributed compromised nodes. The protocol provides
arbitrarily high confidence in the security of the protocol, with modest
scaling of resource costs with improvement of the security parameter. Although
some types of failure are undetectable, users can take preemptive measures to
make the probability of such failures arbitrarily small.

Networks of Complements,"  We consider a network of sellers, each selling a single product, where the
graph structure represents pair-wise complementarities between products. We
study how the network structure affects revenue and social welfare of
equilibria of the pricing game between the sellers. We prove positive and
negative results, both of ""Price of Anarchy"" and of ""Price of Stability"" type,
for special families of graphs (paths, cycles) as well as more general ones
(trees, graphs). We describe best-reply dynamics that converge to non-trivial
equilibrium in several families of graphs, and we use these dynamics to prove
the existence of approximately-efficient equilibria.

"Isoscaling in statistical fragment emission in an extended compound
  nucleus model","  Based on an extended compound nucleus model, isospin effects in statistical
fragment emission from excited nuclear systems are investigated. An
experimentally observed scaling behavior of the ratio of isotope yields
$Y_i(N,Z)$ from two similar emitting sources with different neutron-to-proton
ratios is predicted theoretically, i.e., the relationship of $Y_2/Y_1 \propto
exp(\alpha N + \beta Z)$ is demonstrated. The symmetry energy coefficient
$C_{sym}$ extracted from the simulation results is $\sim$ 27 MeV which is
consistent with realistic theoretical estimates and recent experimental data.
The influence of the surface entropy on the isoscaling behavior is discussed in
detail. It is found that although the surface entropy increases the numercial
values of isoscaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, it does not affect the
isoscaling behavior qualitatively and has only a minor effect on the extracted
symmetry energy coefficient.

From Hopf fibrations to exotic causal replacements,"  Topological solitons are relevant in several areas of physics [1]. Recently,
these configurations have been investigated in contexts as diverse as
hydrodynamics [2], Bose-Einstein condensates [3], ferromagnetism [4], knotted
light [5] and non-abelian gauge theories [6]. In this paper we address the
issue of wave propagation about a static Hopf soliton in the context of the
Nicole model. Working within the geometrical optics limit we show that several
nontrivial lensing effects emerge due to nonlinear interactions as long as the
theory remains hyperbolic. We conclude that similar effects are very likely to
occur in effective field theories characterized by a topological invariant such
as the Skyrme model of pions.

Magnetic Skyrmions for Cache Memory,"  Magnetic skyrmions (MS) are particle-like spin structures with whirling
configuration, which are promising candidates for spin-based memory. MS
contains alluring features including remarkably high stability, ultra low
driving current density, and compact size. Due to their higher stability and
lower drive current requirement for movement, skyrmions have great potential in
energy efficient spintronic device applications. We propose a skyrmion-based
cache memory where data can be stored in a long nanotrack as multiple bits.
Write operation (formation of skyrmion) can be achieved by injecting spin
polarized current in a magnetic nanotrack and subsequently shifting the MS in
either direction along the nanotrack using charge current through a spin-Hall
metal (SHM), underneath the magnetic layer. The presence of skyrmion can alter
the resistance of a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) at the read port.
Considering the read and write latency along the long nanotrack cache memory, a
strategy of multiple read and write operations is discussed. Besides, the size
of a skyrmion affects the packing density, current induced motion velocity, and
readability (change of resistance while sensing the existence of a skyrmion).
Design optimization to mitigate the above effects is also investigated.

The algorithm provides for an efficient dynamic programming formulation of the
state space, the prunes non-optimal states, early on. The paper proves the
correctness of the algorithm and provides an initial experimental validation.

Index maps in the K-theory of graph algebras,"  Let $C^*(E)$ be the graph $C^*$-algebra associated to a graph E and let J be
a gauge invariant ideal in $C^*(E)$. We compute the cyclic six-term exact
sequence in $K$-theory of the associated extension in terms of the adjacency
matrix associated to $E$. The ordered six-term exact sequence is a complete
stable isomorphism invariant for several classes of graph $C^*$-algebras, for
instance those containing a unique proper nontrivial ideal. Further, in many
other cases, infinite collections of such sequences comprise complete
invariants. Our results allow for explicit computation of the invariant, giving
an exact sequence in terms of kernels and cokernels of matrices determined by
the vertex matrix of $E$.

Discrete intrinsic localized modes in a microelectromechanical resonator,"  Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILMs) or Discrete Breathers (DBs) are produced
through a non-linear vibration localization phenomenon. While Anderson
localization is due to lattice defects, the nonlinearity of lattices provides
the basis for ILM excitation. Over the past two decades, these ILMs have been
realized in a wide range of physical systems including photonic crystals,
nonlinear atomic lattices, anti-ferromagnets, coupled Josephson junction arrays
and coupled cantilevers. This paper brings out the feasibility of exciting ILMs
in a standalone mechanical resonator. Through piezoelectric driving and optical
visualization, various intriguing features of ILMs have been recorded. The ILMs
in our system are observed as spectral bushes and their frequencies are much
lower than that of the drive frequency. The excitation of ILMs is mediated
through large amplitude instability following autoparametric excitation of a
sub-harmonic mode. The spatial prevalence of discrete ILM excitations is at
antinodes of the sub-harmonic mode. Further, the ILMs have been observed to be
time-variant and various events including attraction-repulsion (or
splitting-merging) of ILMs and hopping occur during the time evolution of ILMs.

"Theoretical description of heavy impurity transport and its application
  to the modelling of tungsten in JET and ASDEX Upgrade","  Recent developments in theory-based modelling of core heavy impurity
transport are presented, and shown to be necessary for quantitative description
of present experiments in JET and ASDEX Upgrade. The treatment of heavy
impurities is complicated by their large mass and charge, which result in a
strong response to plasma rotation or any small background electrostatic field
in the plasma, such as that generated by anisotropic external heating. These
forces lead to strong poloidal asymmetries of impurity density, which have
recently been added to numerical tools describing both neoclassical and
turbulent transport. Modelling predictions of the steady-state two-dimensional
tungsten impurity distribution are compared with experimental densities
interpreted from soft X-ray diagnostics. The modelling identifies neoclassical
transport enhanced by poloidal asymmetries as the dominant mechanism
responsible for tungsten accumulation in the central core of the plasma.
Depending on the bulk plasma profiles, neoclassical temperature screening can
prevent accumulation, and can be enhanced by externally heated species,
demonstrated here in ICRH plasmas.

Hadrons in the Nuclear Medium,"  Nucleon properties are modified in the nuclear medium. To understand these
modifications and their origin is a central issue in nuclear physics. For
example, a wide variety of QCD-based models, including quark-meson coupling and
chiral-quark soliton models, predict that the nuclear constituents change
properties with increasing density. These changes are predicted to lead to
observable changes in the nucleon structure functions and electromagnetic form
factors.
  We present results from a series of recent experiments at MAMI and Jefferson
Lab, which measured the proton recoil polarization in the 4He(e,e'p)3H reaction
to test these predictions. These results, with the most precise data at Q^2 =
0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and at 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 from E03-104, put strong constraints on
available model calculations, such that below Q^2 = 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 the measured
ratios of polarization-transfer are successfully described in a fully
relativistic calculation when including a medium modification of the proton
form factors or, alternatively, by strong charge-exchange final-state
interactions. We also discuss possible extensions of these studies with
measurements of the 4He(e,e'p)3H and 2H(e,e'p)n reactions as well as with the
neutron knockout in 4He(e,e'n)3He.

"Narrow bandwidth interference filter-stabilized diode laser systems for
  the manipulation of neutral atoms","  We present and investigate different external cavity diode laser (ECDL)
configurations for the manipulation of neutrals atoms, wavelength-stabilized by
a narrow-band high transmission interference filter. A novel diode laser,

one, based on a distributed-feedback (DFB) diode. The linear cavity setup in
all these systems combines a robust and compact design with a high wavelength
tunability and an improved stability of the optical feedback compared to diode
laser setups using diffraction gratings for wavelength discrimination.

"Nonlinear amplification of coherent waves in media with soliton-type
  refractive index pattern","  We derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation for the dynamical
self-diffraction of optical waves in a nonlinear cavity. The case of the
reflection geometry of wave interaction as well as a medium that possesses the
cubic nonlinearity (including a local and a nonlocal nonlinear responses) and
the relaxation is considered. A stable localized spatial structure in the form
of a ""dark"" dissipative soliton is formed in the cavity in the steady state.
The envelope of the intensity pattern, as well as of the dynamical grating
amplitude, takes the shape of a $\tanh$ function. The obtained complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation describes the dynamics of this envelope, at the same
time the evolution of this spatial structure changes the parameters of the
output waves. New effects are predicted in this system due to the
transformation of the dissipative soliton which takes place during the
interaction of a pulse with a continuous wave, such as: retention of the pulse
shape during the transmission of impulses in a long nonlinear cavity; giant
amplification of a seed pulse, which takes energy due to redistribution of the
pump continuous energy into the signal.

"Variable-delay feedback control of unstable steady states in retarded
  time-delayed systems","  We study the stability of unstable steady states in scalar retarded
time-delayed systems subjected to a variable-delay feedback control. The
important aspect of such a control problem is that time-delayed systems are
already infinite-dimensional before the delayed feedback control is turned on.
When the frequency of the modulation is large compared to the system's
dynamics, the analytic approach consists of relating the stability properties
of the resulting variable-delay system with those of an analogous distributed
delay system. Otherwise, the stability domains are obtained by a numerical
integration of the linearized variable-delay system. The analysis shows that
the control domains are significantly larger than those in the usual
time-delayed feedback control, and that the complexity of the domain structure
depends on the form and the frequency of the delay modulation.

"Estimating the parameters of globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099) from
  time-series photometry","  We present the analysis of 26 nights of V and I time-series observations from
2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099). We used our data to
search for variable stars in this cluster and refine the periods of known
variables; we then used our variable star light curves to derive values for the
cluster's parameters. We used difference image analysis to reduce our data to
obtain high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the
cluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light curves of
RR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible. We also derive an
estimate for the age of the cluster by fitting theoretical isochrones to our
colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as
variables, we find that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR
Lyrae variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the
literature. We also detect four other new variables, including an eclipsing
blue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts to a total number
of confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform Fourier decomposition of
the light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to derive cluster parameters using
empirical relations. We find a cluster metallicity [Fe/H]_ZW=-2.01 +- 0.04, or
[Fe/H]_UVES=-2.11 +- 0.06, and a distance of 8.32 +- 0.20 kpc (using RR0
variables), 8.10 kpc (using one RR1 variable), and 8.35 +- 0.42 kpc (using our

"Towards Anisotropy-Free and Non-Singular Bounce Cosmology with
  Scale-invariant Perturbations","  We investigate non-singular bounce realizations in the framework of
ghost-free generalized Galileon cosmology, which furthermore can be free of the
anisotropy problem. Considering an Ekpyrotic-like potential we can obtain a
total Equation-of-State (EoS) larger than one in the contracting phase, which
is necessary for the evolution to be stable against small anisotropic
fluctuations. Since such a large EoS forbids the Galileon field to generate the
desired form of perturbations, we additionally introduce the curvaton field
which can in general produce the observed nearly scale-invariant spectrum. In
particular, we provide approximate analytical and exact semi-analytical
expressions under which the bouncing scenario is consistent with observations.
Finally, the combined Galileon-curvaton system is free of the Big-Rip after the
bounce.

Cooperative Learning with Visual Attributes,"  Learning paradigms involving varying levels of supervision have received a
lot of interest within the computer vision and machine learning communities.
The supervisory information is typically considered to come from a human
supervisor -- a ""teacher"" figure. In this paper, we consider an alternate
source of supervision -- a ""peer"" -- i.e. a different machine. We introduce
cooperative learning, where two agents trying to learn the same visual
concepts, but in potentially different environments using different sources of
data (sensors), communicate their current knowledge of these concepts to each
other. Given the distinct sources of data in both agents, the mode of
communication between the two agents is not obvious. We propose the use of
visual attributes -- semantic mid-level visual properties such as furry,
wooden, etc.-- as the mode of communication between the agents. Our experiments
in three domains -- objects, scenes, and animals -- demonstrate that our
proposed cooperative learning approach improves the performance of both agents
as compared to their performance if they were to learn in isolation. Our
approach is particularly applicable in scenarios where privacy, security and/or
bandwidth constraints restrict the amount and type of information the two
agents can exchange.

Nondiscriminatory Propagation on Trees,"  We consider a discrete-time dynamical process on graphs, firstly introduced
in connection with a protocol for controlling large networks of spin 1/2
quantum mechanical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 100501 (2007)]. A
description is as follows: each vertex of an initially selected set has a
packet of information (the same for every element of the set), which will be
distributed among vertices of the graph; a vertex v can pass its packet to an
adjacent vertex w only if w is its only neighbour without the information. By
mean of examples, we describe some general properties, mainly concerning
homeomorphism, and redundant edges. We prove that the cardinality of the
smallest sets propagating the information in all vertices of a balanced m-ary
tree of depth k is exactly (m^{k+1}+(-1)^{k})/(m+1). For binary trees, this
number is related to alternating sign matrices.

Bernoulli actions and infinite entropy,"  We show that, for countable sofic groups, a Bernoulli action with infinite
entropy base has infinite entropy with respect to every sofic approximation
sequence. This builds on the work of Lewis Bowen in the case of finite entropy
base and completes the computation of measure entropy for Bernoulli actions
over countable sofic groups. One consequence is that such a Bernoulli action
fails to have a generating countable partition with finite entropy if the base
has infinite entropy, which in the amenable case is well known and in the case
that the acting group contains the free group on two generators was established
by Bowen using a different argument.

"The role of stellar relaxation in the formation and evolution of the
  first massive black holes","  We present calculations on the formation of massive black holes with 10^5
Msun at z > 6 that can be the seeds of supermassive black holes at z > 6. Under
the assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging galaxies, star
clusters in haloes of 10^8 ~ 10^9 Msun can undergo rapid core-collapse leading
to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) with ~1000 Msun which directly
collapse into black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in halos of > 10^9
Msun experience type-II supernovae before the formation of VMSs due to long
core-collapse time scales. We also model the subsequent growth of black holes
via accretion of residual stars in clusters. 2-body relaxation efficiently
re-fills the loss cones of stellar orbits at larger radii and resonant
relaxation at small radii is the main driver for accretion of stars onto black
holes. As a result, more than ninety percent of stars in the initial cluster
are swallowed by the central black holes before z=6. Using dark matter merger
trees we derive black hole mass functions at z=6-20. The mass function ranges
from 10^3 to 10^5 Msun at z <~ 15. Major merging of galaxies of >~ 4*10^8 Msun
at z ~ 20 successfully leads to the formation of >~ 10^5 Msun BHs by z >~ 10
which can be the potential seeds of supermassive black holes seen today.

Prepositions in Context,"  Prepositions are highly polysemous, and their variegated senses encode
significant semantic information. In this paper we match each preposition's
complement and attachment and their interplay crucially to the geometry of the
word vectors to the left and right of the preposition. Extracting such features
from the vast number of instances of each preposition and clustering them makes
for an efficient preposition sense disambigution (PSD) algorithm, which is
comparable to and better than state-of-the-art on two benchmark datasets. Our
reliance on no external linguistic resource allows us to scale the PSD
algorithm to a large WikiCorpus and learn sense-specific preposition
representations -- which we show to encode semantic relations and paraphrasing
of verb particle compounds, via simple vector operations.

Simulation of quasi-stationary distributions on countable spaces,"  Quasi-stationary distributions (QSD) have been widely studied since the
pioneering work of Kolmogorov (1938), Yaglom (1947) and Sevastyanov (1951).
They appear as a natural object when considering Markov processes that are
certainly absorbed since they are invariant for the evolution of the
distribution of the process conditioned on not being absorbed. They hence
appropriately describe the state of the process at large times for non absorbed
paths. Unlike invariant distributions for Markov processes, QSD are solutions
of a non-linear equation and there can be 0, 1 or an infinity of them. Also,
they cannot be obtained as Ces\`aro limits of Markovian dynamics. These facts
make the computation of QSDs a nontrivial matter. We review different
approximation methods for QSD that are useful for simulation purposes, mainly
focused on Fleming-Viot dynamics. We also give some alternative proofs and
extensions of known results.

"Size fluctuations of the initial source and the event-by-event
  transverse momentum fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions","  We show that the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse size of the
initial source, which follow directly from the Glauber treatment of the
earliest stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, cause, after hydrodynamic
evolution, fluctuations of the transverse flow velocity at hadronic freeze-out.
This in turn leads to event-by-event fluctuations of the average transverse
momentum, p_T. Simulations with GLISSANDO for the Glauber phase, followed by a
realistic hydrodynamic evolution and statistical hadronization carried out with
THERMINATOR, lead to agreement with the RHIC data. In particular, the magnitude
of the effect, its centrality dependence, and the weak dependence on the
incident energy are properly reproduced. Our results show that bulk of the
observed event-by-event p_T fluctuations may be explained by the fluctuations
of the size of the initial source.

studied using numerical and analytical approaches. The entropy $S(H,T)$ and

behaviors in different regions of the magnetic field. The field-dependence of
the specific heat is almost symmetric about the average of quantum critical
fields in complete agreement with experimental results. In addition, it is
found that during an adiabatic demagnetization process, temperature drops in
the vicinity of the field induced zero-temperature quantum phase transitions.

Cobordism invariants of the moduli space of stable pairs,"  For a quasi-projective scheme M which carries a perfect obstruction theory,
we construct the virtual cobordism class of M. If M is projective, we prove
that the corresponding Chern numbers of the virtual cobordism class are given
by integrals of the Chern classes of the virtual tangent bundle. Further, we
study cobordism invariants of the moduli space of stable pairs introduced by
Pandharipande-Thomas. Rationality of the partition function is conjectured
together with a functional equation, which can be regarded as a generalization
of the rationality and 1/q <-> q symmetry of the Calabi-Yau case. We prove
rationality for nonsingular projective toric 3-folds by the theory of
descendents.

Boson-sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure,"  Boson-sampling has attracted much interest as a simplified approach to
implementing a subset of optical quantum computing. Boson-sampling requires
indistinguishable photons, but far fewer of them than universal optical quantum
computing architectures. In reality, photons are never indistinguishable, and
exhibit a rich spectral structure. Here we consider the operation of
boson-sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure and relate the
sampling statistics of the device to matrix permanents. This sheds light on the
computational complexity of different regimes of the photons' spectral
characteristics, and provides very general results for the operation of linear
optics interferometers in the presence of partially distinguishable photons.
Our results apply to both the cases of spectrally resolving and non-spectrally
resolving detectors.

Level-crossing and modal structure in microdroplet resonators,"  We fabricate a liquid-core liquid-clad microcavity that is coupled to a

modes of this droplet resonator. The shape of our resonator is similar to a

suggesting that some of them will share the same resonance frequency. Indeed,
we experimentally observe that more than half of the droplet's modes have a
sibling having the same frequency (to within linewidth) and therefore
exhibiting a standing interference-pattern.

"Evolution of Scientific Collaboration Network Driven by Homophily and
  Heterophily","  Many scientific collaboration networks exhibit clear community and small
world structures. However, the studies on the underlying mechanisms for the
formation and evolution of community and small world structures are still
insufficient. The mechanisms of homophily and heterophily based on scholars'
traits are two important factors for the formation of community and
inter-communal links, which may deserve further exploration. In this paper, a
multi-agent model, which is based on combinatorial effects of homophily and
heterophily, is developed to investigate the evolution of scientific
collaboration networks. The simulation results indicate that agents with
similar traits aggregate to form community by homophily, while heterophily
plays a major role in the formation of inter-communal links. The pattern of
network evolution revealed in simulations is essentially consistent with what
is observed in empirical analyses, as in both cases the giant component evolves
from a small cluster to a structure of chained-communities, and then to a small
world network with community structure. This work may provides an alternative
view on the underlying mechanisms for the formation of community and small
world structures, complementary to the mainstream view that the small-world is
generated from the combination of the structural embeddedness and structural
holes mechanisms.

Scaling Relations Between Low-mass Black Holes and Their Host Galaxies,"  It is well established that supermassive black holes in nearby elliptical
galaxies correlate tightly with the kinematic property ($\mbhsigma$
correlation) and stellar mass ($\mbhhost$ correlation) of their host spheroids.
However, it is not clear what the relations would be at the low-mass end, and
how they evolve. Here, we investigate these relations in low-mass systems
($\MBH \sim \rm{10^{6}- 10^{8}}\, \Msun$) using the Aquila Simulation, a
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation which follows the
formation and evolution of stars and black holes in a Milky Way-size galaxy and
its substructures. We find a number of interesting results on the origin and
evolution of the scaling relations in these systems: (1) there is a strong
redshift evolution in the $\mbhsigma$ relation, but a much weaker one in the
$\mbhhost$ relation; (2) there is a close link between the $\mbhsigma$ relation
and the dynamical state of the system -- the galaxies that fall on the observed
correlation appear to have reached virial equilibrium. (3) the star formation
and black hole growth are self-regulated in galaxies -- the ratio between black
hole accretion rate and star formation rate remains nearly constant in a wide
redshift span $z = 0-6$. These findings suggest that the observed correlations
have different origins: the $\mbhsigma$ relation may be the result of virial
equilibrium, while the $\mbhhost$ relation may the result of self-regulated
star formation and black hole growth in galaxies.

Fixed point theorems in plane continua with applications,"  We present proofs of basic results, including those developed by Harold Bell,
for the plane fixed point problem: does every map of a non-separating plane
continuum have a fixed point? Some of these results had been announced much
earlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the
variation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the
map on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively
oriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results
announced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line
which sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We
generalize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively
oriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These
methods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are
degenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a
special case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant
subcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer
points and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a
point. It follows that impressions of some external rays to polynomial Julia
sets are degenerate.

Network Topology Identification from Spectral Templates,"  Network topology inference is a cornerstone problem in statistical analyses
of complex systems. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates
benefits from convex optimization and graph signal processing, to identify the
so-termed graph shift operator (encoding the network topology) given only the
eigenvectors of the shift. These spectral templates can be obtained, for
example, from principal component analysis of a set of graph signals defined on
the particular network. The novel idea is to find a graph shift that while
being consistent with the provided spectral information, it endows the network
structure with certain desired properties such as sparsity. The focus is on
developing efficient recovery algorithms along with identifiability conditions
for two particular shifts, the adjacency matrix and the normalized graph
Laplacian. Application domains include network topology identification from
steady-state signals generated by a diffusion process, and design of a graph
filter that facilitates the distributed implementation of a prescribed linear

Extraordinary transmission of nanohole lattices in gold films,"  We study experimentally the transmission of light through a square lattice of
nanoholes perforated in a optically-thick gold film. We observe that the
periodicity of the structure enhances the light transmission for specific
wavelengths, and we analyze this effect theoretically by employing
finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations. Furthermore, we
investigate the possibilities for manipulation of the spectral transmission in
quasi-periodic and chirped lattices consisting of square nanoholes with varying
hole size or lattice periodicity.

"In a distinguishing spacetime the horismos relation generates the causal
  relation","  It is proved that in a distinguishing spacetime the horismos relation
E^+=J^+\I^+ generates the causal relation J^+. In other words two causally
related events are joined by a chain of horismotically related events, or
again, the causal relation is the smallest transitive relation containing the
horismos relation. The result is sharp in the sense that distinction can not be
weakened to future or past distinction. Finally, it is proved that a spacetime
in which the horismos relation generates the causal relation is necessarily
non-total imprisoning.

"The clustering of galaxies in the completed SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation
  Spectroscopic Survey: Angular clustering tomography and its cosmological
  implications","  We investigate the cosmological implications of studying galaxy clustering
using a tomographic approach applied to the final BOSS DR12 galaxy sample,
including both auto- and cross-correlation functions between redshift shells.
We model the signal of the full shape of the angular correlation function,
$\omega(\theta)$, in redshift bins using state-of-the-art modelling of
non-linearities, bias and redshift-space distortions. We present results on the
redshift evolution of the linear bias of BOSS galaxies, which cannot be
obtained with traditional methods for galaxy-clustering analysis. We also
obtain constraints on cosmological parameters, combining this tomographic
analysis with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia
supernova (SNIa). We explore a number of cosmological models, including the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model and its most interesting extensions, such as
deviations from $w_\rm{DE} = -1$, non-minimal neutrino masses, spatial
curvature and deviations from general relativity using the growth-index
$\gamma$ parametrisation. These results are, in general, comparable to the most
precise present-day constraints on cosmological parameters, and show very good
agreement with the standard model. In particular, combining CMB,
$\omega(\theta)$ and SNIa, we find a value of $w_\rm{DE}$ consistent with $-1$
to a precision better than 5\% when it is assumed to be constant in time, and
better than 6\% when we also allow for a spatially-curved Universe.

  These orderings are useful to understand the phenomenon of positive ageing
classes and also helpful to guide the practitioners when there are crossing
hazard rates and/or crossing mean residual lives. We study some
characterizations of these orderings. Inter-relations among these orderings
have also been discussed.

Butterflies II: Torsors for 2-group stacks,"  We study torsors over 2-groups and their morphisms. In particular, we study
the first non-abelian cohomology group with values in a 2-group. Butterfly
diagrams encode morphisms of 2-groups and we employ them to examine the
functorial behavior of non-abelian cohomology under change of coefficients. We
re-interpret the first non-abelian cohomology with coefficients in a 2-group in
terms of gerbes bound by a crossed module. Our main result is to provide a
geometric version of the change of coefficients map by lifting a gerbe along
the ""fraction"" (weak morphism) determined by a butterfly. As a practical
byproduct, we show how butterflies can be used to obtain explicit maps at the
cocycle level. In addition, we discuss various commutativity conditions on
cohomology induced by various degrees of commutativity on the coefficient
2-groups, as well as specific features pertaining to group extensions.

Ideal magnetic dipole scattering,"  We introduce the concept of tunable ideal magnetic dipole scattering, where a
nonmagnetic nanoparticle scatters lights as a pure magnetic dipole. High
refractive index subwavelength nanoparticles usually support both electric and
magnetic dipole responses. Thus, to achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering
one has to suppress the electric dipole response. Such a possibility was
recently demonstrated for the so-called anapole mode, which is associated with
zero electric dipole scattering. By overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with
the anapole mode we achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering in the far-field
with tunable high scattering resonances in near infrared spectrum. We
demonstrate that such condition can be realized for two subwavelength
geometries. One of them is core-shell nanosphere consisting of Au core and
silicon shell. It can be also achieved in other geometries, including
nanodisks, which are compatible with current nanofabrication technology.

Many-Body Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Crystal Polymorphism,"  Polymorphs in molecular crystals are often very close in energy, yet they may
possess markedly different physical and chemical properties. The understanding
and prediction of polymorphism is of paramount importance for a variety of
applications, including pharmaceuticals, non-linear optics, and hydrogen
storage. Here, we show that the non-additive many-body dispersion (MBD) energy
beyond the standard pairwise approximation is crucial for the correct
qualitative and quantitative description of polymorphism in molecular crystals.
This is rationalized by the sensitive dependence of the MBD energy on the
polymorph geometry and the ensuing dynamic electric fields inside molecular
crystals. We use the glycine crystal as a fundamental and stringent benchmark
case to demonstrate the accuracy of the DFT+MBD method.

"Prediction of residue-residue contacts from protein families using
  similarity kernels and least squares regularization","  One of the most challenging and long-standing problems in computational
biology is the prediction of three-dimensional protein structure from amino
acid sequence. A promising approach to infer spatial proximity between residues
is the study of evolutionary covariance from multiple sequence alignments,
especially in light of recent algorithmic improvements and the fast growing
size of sequence databases. In this paper, we present a simple, fast and
accurate algorithm for the prediction of residue-residue contacts based on
regularized least squares. The basic assumption is that spatially proximal
residues in a protein coevolve to maintain the physicochemical complementarity
of the amino acids involved in the contact. Our regularized inversion of the
sample covariance matrix allows the computation of partial correlations between
pairs of residues, thereby removing the effect of spurious transitive
correlations. The method also accounts for low number of observations by means
of a regularization parameter that depends on the effective number of sequences
in the alignment. When tested on a set of protein families from Pfam, we found
the RLS algorithm to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods
for contact prediction, while at the same time being faster and conceptually
simpler.

Difficulty of distinguishing product states locally,"  Non-locality without entanglement is a rather counter-intuitive phenomenon in
which information may be encoded entirely in product (unentangled) states of
composite quantum systems in such a way that local measurement of the
subsystems is not enough for optimal decoding. For simple examples of pure
product states, the gap in performance is known to be rather small when
arbitrary local strategies are allowed. Here we restrict to local strategies
readily achievable with current technology; those requiring neither a quantum
memory nor joint operations. We show that, even for measurements on pure
product states there can be a large gap between such strategies and
theoretically optimal performance. Thus even in the absence of entanglement
physically realizable local strategies can be far from optimal for extracting
quantum information.

Resolving the ultrafast dynamics of charge carriers in nanocomposites,"  Here we describe an optical method to determine the dynamics of optically

time-resolved reflectivity with scattering measurements, we extract the
characteristic times for charge carrier evolution. We use the 3D

model the results. The method, applied to hydrogenated amorphous silicon
containing crystalline silicon nanoparticles, showed that the recombination
times in the nanocrystals and in the matrix were ~4.9 ps and ~22 ps,
respectively. The charge transfer time between the crystals and the matrix was
~4 ps.

"Topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid in spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi
  gases","  We theoretically predict a new topological matter - topological inhomogeneous
Fulde-Ferrell superfluid - in one-dimensional atomic Fermi gases with equal
Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling near s-wave Feshbach resonances. The
realization of such a spin-orbit coupled Fermi system has already been
demonstrated recently by using a two-photon Raman process and the extra
one-dimensional confinement is easy to achieve using a tight two-dimensional
optical lattice. The topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid phase is
characterized by a nonzero center-of-mass momentum and a non-trivial Berry
phase. By tuning the Rabi frequency and the detuning of Raman laser beams, we
show that such an exotic topological phase occupies a significant part of
parameter space and therefore it could be easily observed experimentally, by
using, for example, momentum-resolved and spatially resolved radio-frequency
spectroscopy.

distribution in a chiral p-wave superconductor. We use the quasiclassical

behaviour of the surface layer. We calculate angle resolved distributions of
the spontaneous surface currents and formulate the conditions of their
observability. We argue that local measurements of these currents by muSR
technique may provide an information on the underlying pairing symmetry in the
bulk superconductor.

"HII Regions, Embedded Protostars, and Starless Cores in Sharpless 2-157","  We present arcsecond resolution 1.4mm observations of the high mass star
forming region, Sharpless 2-157, that reveal the cool dust associated with the
first stages of star formation. These data are compared with archival images at
optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths, and complemented with new arcsecond
resolution mid-infrared data. We identify a dusty young HII region, numerous
infrared sources within the cluster envelope, and four starless condensations.
Three of the cores lie in a line to the south of the cluster peak, but the most
massive one is right at the center and associated with a jumble of bright radio
and infrared sources. This presents an interesting juxtaposition of high and
low mass star formation within the same cluster which we compare with similar
observations of other high mass star forming regions and discuss in the context
of cluster formation theory.

"In Quantum Computing Speedup Illusory?: The False Coin of ""Counting
  Function Evaluations""","  By using a new way to encode Boolean functions in a reversible gate, an
algorithm is developed in quantum computing over Z_2, symbolized QC/2, (as
opposed to QC over C) that needs only one function evaluation to solve the
Grover Database Search Problem of finding a designated record among 2^m records
for any m. In the usual Grover algorithm in quantum computing over C, one needs
essentially Sqrt(2^m) function evaluations as opposed to the average of (2^m)/2
functions evaluations needed in the classical algorithm. The one function
evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm (for any m) represents such a super speedup,
even over the Grover algorithm in QC/C, that one feels something has gone awry.
Indeed, our analysis of the transparent calculations of Boolean functions over
Z_2 shows that the classical algorithm is just repackaged in a rather obvious
way in the single function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm--whereas the
calculations are hidden and non-transparent in the Grover QC/C algorithm using
C. The conclusion in both cases (which is rather obvious in the QC/2 case) is
that ""counting function evaluations"" is a false coin to measure speedup in the
comparison between quantum and classical computing.

Atomic Zitterbewegung,"  Ultra-cold atoms which are subject to ultra-relativistic dynamics are
investigated. By using optically induced gauge potentials we show that the
dynamics of the atoms is governed by a Dirac type equation. To illustrate this
we study the trembling motion of the centre of mass for an effective two level
system, historically called Zitterbewegung. Its origin is described in detail,
where in particular the role of the finite width of the atomic wave packets is
seen to induce a damping of both the centre of mass dynamics and the dynamics
of the populations of the two levels.

"BEER analysis of Kepler and CoRoT light curves: discovering binaries and
  exoplanets","  This thesis consists of seven scientific papers that cover the
proof-of-concept, the development, and discoveries made through the use of the
BEER (BEaming, Ellipsoidal, and Reflection) algorithm for searching for
companions in the light curves from the Kepler and CoRoT space telescopes.
  Paper I presents the detection of the ellipsoidal and the beaming effects in
the CoRoT light curve of CoRoT-3, a system of a $22$$M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarf
orbiting an F star with an orbital period of $4.3$ days. This work served as a
proof-of-concept that these effects are detectable in the space light curves of
systems with brown-dwarf or planetary secondaries, thus indicating that similar
modulations may be detected in the light curves of non-transiting systems.
  Abridged...
  The last study, Paper VII, demonstrates the different strengths and utility
of the BEER search algorithm. It presents the discovery of four short-period
eclipsing binaries in the Kepler light curves, consisting of an A-star primary
and a low-mass WD secondary (dA+WD). The systems show BEER phase modulations
together with primary and secondary eclipses. These add to the 6 Kepler, and 18
WASP, previously known short-period eclipsing dA+WD binaries. The paper shows
that three of the new systems harbor the smallest WDs detected so far in such
binaries. These three binaries extend the previously known population to older
systems with cooler and smaller WD secondaries, allowing to test binary
evolution theories in a parameter region not observed before.
  The seven papers illustrate the effectiveness of the BEER algorithm in
finding both common stellar binaries and rare astrophysical objects. As such,
the BEER tool can serve as an important component in the virtual astronomy
toolbox for mining the vast astronomical data produced by current and future
photometric surveys. Abridged.

"Singular equivalences of functor categories via Auslander-Buchweitz
  approximations","  The aim of this paper is to construct singular equivalences between functor
categories. As a special case, we show that there exists a singular equivalence
arising from a cotilting module $T$, namely, the singularity category of
$(^\perp T)/[T]$ and that of $(\mod A)/[T]$ are triangle equivalent. In
particular, the canonical module $\omega$ over a commutative Noetherian ring
induces a singular equivalence between $(\mathsf{CM}R)/[\omega]$ and $(\mod
R)/[\omega]$, which generalizes Matsui-Takahashi's theorem. Our result is based
on a sufficient condition for an additive category $\mathcal{A}$ and its
subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ so that the canonical inclusion
$\mathcal{X}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{A}$ induces a singular equivalence
$\mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{A})\simeq \mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{X})$, which is a
functor category version of Xiao-Wu Chen's theorem.

summarizing the research during the early years, when the basic optical
properties were investigated, we describe the important results related to the
phenomenon of parametric polariton scattering, highlighting its link to
non-classical polariton physics. We conclude with a perspective view of the
future research in the domain, focusing on the exciting developments in the
direction of polariton quantum collective phenomena and quantum nanodevices

Science results from the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SpIOMM,"  SpIOMM is an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer designed to obtain the
visible range (350 to 850 nm) spectrum of every light source in a circular
field of view of 12 arcminutes in diameter. It is attached to the 1.6-m
telescope of the Observatoire du Mont Megantic in southern Quebec. We present
here some results of three successful observing runs in 2007, which highlight
SpIOMMs capabilities to map emission line objects over a very wide field of
view and a broad spectral range. In particular, we discuss data cubes from the
planetary nebula M27, the supernova remnants NGC 6992 and M1, the barred spiral
galaxy NGC7479, as well as Stephans quintet, an interacting group of galaxies.

Fibonacci Designs,"  A Metis design is one for which v=r+k+1. This paper deals with Metis designs
that are quasi-residual. The parameters of such designs and the corresponding
symmetric designs can be expressed by Fibonacci numbers. Although the question
of existence seems intractable because of the size of the designs, the
nonexistence of corresponding difference sets can be dealt with in a
substantive way. We also recall some inequalities for the number of fixed
points of an automorphism of a symmetric design and suggest possible
connections to the designs that would be the symmetric extensions of Metis
designs.

"HBTM: A Heartbeat-based Behavior Detection Mechanism for POSIX Threads
  and OpenMP Applications","  Extreme-scale computing involves hundreds of millions of threads with
multi-level parallelism running on large-scale hierarchical and heterogeneous
hardware. In POSIX threads and OpenMP applications, some key behaviors
occurring in runtime such as thread failure, busy waiting, and exit need to be
accurately and timely detected. However, for the most of these applications,
there are lack of unified and efficient detection mechanisms to do this. In
this paper, a heartbeat-based behavior detection mechanism for POSIX threads
(Pthreads) and OpenMP applications (HBTM) is proposed. In the design, two types
of implementations are conducted, centralized and decentralized respectively.
In both implementations, unified API has been designed to guarantee the
generality of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a ring-based detection algorithm is
designed to ease the burden of the centra thread at runtime. To evaluate the
mechanism, the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) are used to test the performance
of the HBTM. The experimental results show that the HBTM supports detection of
behaviors of POSIX threads and OpenMP applications while acquiring a short
latency and near 1% overhead.

Cloud Network Management Model A Novel Approach to Manage Cloud Traffic,"  Cloud is in the air. More and More companies and personals are connecting to
cloud with so many variety of offering provided by the companies. The cloud
services are based on Internet i.e. TCP IP. The paper discusses limitations of
one of the main existing network management protocol i.e. Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The
network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked
environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the
traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the
network condition. The proposed Model Cloud Network Management Model provides a
comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to
improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional TCP IP
network management protocol). Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet
exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems
exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the
manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized
technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure
packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to
manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a
theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The
model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and
protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported
algorithms.

"Disc truncation in embedded star clusters: Dynamical encounters versus
  face-on accretion","  Observations indicate that the dispersal of protoplanetary discs in star
clusters occurs on time scales of about 5 Myr. Several processes are thought to
be responsible for this disc dispersal. Here we compare two of these processes:
dynamical encounters and interaction with the interstellar medium, which
includes face-on accretion and ram pressure stripping. We perform simulations
of embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to
determine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant. We
find that face-on accretion, including ram pressure stripping, is the dominant
disc truncation process if the fraction of the total cluster mass in stars is
$\lesssim 30\,\%$ regardless of the cluster mass and radius. Dynamical
encounters require stellar densities $\gtrsim 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$ combined with a
mass fraction in stars of $\approx 90\,\%$ to become the dominant process. Our
results show that during the embedded phase of the cluster, the truncation of
the discs is dominated by face-on accretion and dynamical encounters become
dominant when the intra-cluster gas has been expelled. As a result of face-on
accretion the protoplanetary discs become compact and their surface density
increases. In contrast, dynamical encounters lead to discs that are less
massive and remain larger.

"Dynamical magnetic enhancement of light and heavy quark jet quenching at
  RHIC","  A new Monte Carlo implementation of Djordjevic's dynamical scattering
generalization of the DGLV radiative energy loss opacity series is used with a
hybrid interpolation scheme to compute both light and heavy quark jet quenching
up to third order in opacity. The enhancement of the ratio of bottom to charm
quark energy loss due to perturbative long range color magnetic effects in
nonuniform Bjorken expanding geometries is found to reduce the significance of
the heavy quark jet puzzle posed by the observed near equality (within sizeable
errors) of pion and nonphotonic electron nuclear modification at RHIC. Jet
Flavor Spectroscopy discussed below will be a powerful tool to differentiate
competing dynamical models of the QGP produced in ultra-relativistic nuclear
collisions.

Analytic Reflected Lightcurves for Exoplanets,"  The disk-integrated reflected brightness of an exoplanet changes as a
function of time due to orbital and rotational motion coupled with an
inhomogeneous albedo map. We have previously derived analytic reflected
lightcurves for spherical harmonic albedo maps in the special case of a
synchronously-rotating planet on an edge-on orbit (Cowan, Fuentes & Haggard
2013). In this paper, we present analytic reflected lightcurves for the general
case of a planet on an inclined orbit, with arbitrary spin period and non-zero
obliquity. We do so for two different albedo basis maps: bright points
($\delta$-maps), and spherical harmonics ($Y_l^m$-maps). In particular, we use
Wigner $D$-matrices to express an harmonic lightcurve for an arbitrary viewing
geometry as a non-linear combination of harmonic lightcurves for the simpler
edge-on, synchronously rotating geometry. These solutions will enable future
exploration of the degeneracies and information content of reflected
lightcurves, as well as fast calculation of lightcurves for mapping exoplanets
based on time-resolved photometry. To these ends we make available Exoplanet
Analytic Reflected Lightcurves (EARL), a simple open-source code that allows
rapid computation of reflected lightcurves.

On the Hidden Maxwell Superalgebra underlying D=4 Supergravity,"  In this work, we expand the hidden $AdS$-Lorentz superalgebra underlying
$D=4$ supergravity, reaching a (hidden) Maxwell superalgebra. The latter can be
viewed as an extension involving cosmological constant of the superalgebra
underlying $D=4$ supergravity in flat spacetime. We write the Maurer-Cartan
equations in this context and we find some interesting extensions of the
antisymmetric $3$-form $A^{(3)}$ appearing in the Free Differential Algebra in
Minkowski space. The structure of Free Differential Algebras is obtained by
considering the zero curvature equations. We write the parametrization of
$A^{(3)}$ in terms of $1$-forms and we rend the topological features of its
extensions manifest. We interestingly find out that the structure of these
extensions, and consequently the structure of the corresponding boundary
contribution $dA^{(3)}$, strongly depends on the form of the extra fermionic
generator appearing in the hidden Maxwell superalgebra. The model we develop in
this work is defined in an enlarged superspace with respect to the ordinary
one, and the extra bosonic and fermionic $1$-forms required for the closure of
the hidden Maxwell superalgebra must be considered as physical fields in this
enlarged superspace.

Regular and Biregular module algebras,"  Motivated by the study of von Neumann regular skew groups as carried out by
Alfaro, Ara and del Rio in 1995 we investigate regular and biregular Hopf
module algebras. If $A$ is an algebra with an action by an affine Hopf algebra
$H$, then any $H$-stable left ideal of $A$ is a direct summand if and only if
$A^H$ is regular and the invariance functor $(-)^H$ induces an equivalence of
$A^H$-Mod to the Wisbauer category of $A$ as $A# H$-module. Analogously we show
a similar statement for the biregularity of $A$ relative to $H$ where $A^H$ is
replaced by $R=Z(A)\cap A^H$ using the module theory of $A$ as a module over
$A\otimes A^{op} \bowtie H$ the envelopping Hopf algebroid of $A$ and $H$. We
show that every two-sided $H$-stable ideal of $A$ is generated by a central
$H$-invariant idempotent if and only if $R$ is regular and $A_m$ is $H$-simple
for all maximal ideals $m$ of $R$. Further sufficient conditions are given for
$A# H$ and $A^H$ to be regular.

"Feature Studies to Inform the Classification of Depressive Symptoms from
  Twitter Data for Population Health","  The utility of Twitter data as a medium to support population-level mental
health monitoring is not well understood. In an effort to better understand the
predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence
of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a
large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first
experiment, we assessed the contribution of feature groups such as lexical
information (e.g., unigrams) and emotions (e.g., strongly negative) using a
feature ablation study. In the second experiment, we determined the percentile
of top ranked features that produced the optimal classification performance by
applying a three-step feature elimination approach. In the first experiment, we
observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive
symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep
(-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score
performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across
classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to
depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no
consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets. We
conclude that simple lexical features and reduced feature sets can produce
comparable results to larger feature sets.

"Inferring the mesoscale structure of layered, edge-valued and
  time-varying networks","  Many network systems are composed of interdependent but distinct types of
interactions, which cannot be fully understood in isolation. These different
types of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges
or as a time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for
a more comprehensive scientific understanding, these representations offer
substantial challenges. Namely, it is an open problem how to precisely
characterize the large or mesoscale structure of network systems in relation to
these additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of these
features invariably increases the effective dimension of the network
description, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the use of
overly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations for
actual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to
tackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network
structure, incorporating layered, attributed and time-varying properties, as
well as a nonparametric Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data
and select the most appropriate model according to statistical evidence. We
show that the method is capable of revealing hidden structure in layered,
edge-valued and time-varying networks, and that the most appropriate level of
granularity with respect to the additional dimensions can be reliably
identified. We illustrate our approach on a variety of empirical systems,
including a social network of physicians, the voting correlations of deputies
in the Brazilian national congress, the global airport network, and a proximity
network of high-school students.

"Observing interferences between past and future quantum states in
  resonance fluorescence","  In quantum physics, measurement results are random but their statistics can
be predicted assuming some knowledge about the system in the past. Additional
knowledge from a future measurement deeply changes the statistics in the
present and leads to purely quantum features. In particular conditioned average
outcomes of a weak measurement, so-called weak values, were shown to go beyond
the conventional range, give a way to directly measure complex quantities, and
can be used to enhance the sensitivity of quantum meters. Recently, these
concepts have been considered in the general case of open quantum systems where
decoherence occurs. Then, what are the properties of weak values for the
unavoidable measurement associated to decoherence, the one performed by the
environment? Here, we answer this question in the simplest open quantum system:
a quantum bit in presence of a relaxation channel. We continuously monitor the
fluorescence emitted by a superconducting qubit driven at resonance.
Conditioned on initial preparation and final single shot measurement outcome of
the qubit state, we probe weak values displaying all the above properties. The
fluorescence signal exhibits interferences between oscillations associated to
past and future quantum states. The measured data are in complete agreement
with theory.

Structure and Substructure of Galactic Spheroids,"  The full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types and
environments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observations
of galaxy formation at high redshift. The next decade brings the observational
opportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formation
and assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority of
the stellar mass in the Universe but have until now been difficult to study. In
order to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal ""red-sequence"",
various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly with
resolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, can
be scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation is
increasingly available. At the same time, progress in adaptive optics on giant
telescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric and
spectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,
thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. Strong theoretical support is needed in
order to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling and

Simplicity criteria for etale groupoid $C^*$-algebras,"  We develop a framework suitable for obtaining simplicity criteria for reduced
$C^*$-algebras of Hausdorff etale groupoids. This is based on the study of
certain non-degenerate $C^*$-subalgebras (in the case of groupoids, the
$C^*$-algebra of the interior isotropy bundle), for which one can control
(non-unique) state extensions to the ambient C*-algebra. As an application, we
give simplicity criteria for reduced crossed products of abelian $C^*$-algebras
by discrete groups.

"Correlation effects and collective excitations in bosonic bilayers: role
  of quantum statistics, superfluidity and dimerization transition","  A two-component two-dimensional (2D) dipolar bosonic system in the bilayer
geometry is considered. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a wide
range of layer spacings we analyze in detail the pair correlation functions,
the static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing
the layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer
states. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,
suppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation
spectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\em
in-phase} (symmetric) and {\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,
during the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic
reconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode
spectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer
superfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\gamma_s=\rho_s/\rho$). In
a pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is
recovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously,
and the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a
superfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly
with $\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\gamma_s$ is
reduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the
interlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by
static and dynamic properties.

"Interplay of insurance and financial risks in a discrete-time model with
  strongly regular variation","  Consider an insurance company exposed to a stochastic economic environment
that contains two kinds of risk. The first kind is the insurance risk caused by
traditional insurance claims, and the second kind is the financial risk
resulting from investments. Its wealth process is described in a standard
discrete-time model in which, during each period, the insurance risk is
quantified as a real-valued random variable $X$ equal to the total amount of
claims less premiums, and the financial risk as a positive random variable $Y$
equal to the reciprocal of the stochastic accumulation factor. This risk model
builds an efficient platform for investigating the interplay of the two kinds
of risk. We focus on the ruin probability and the tail probability of the
aggregate risk amount. Assuming that every convex combination of the
distributions of $X$ and $Y$ is of strongly regular variation, we derive some
precise asymptotic formulas for these probabilities with both finite and
infinite time horizons, all in the form of linear combinations of the tail
probabilities of $X$ and $Y$. Our treatment is unified in the sense that no
dominating relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is required.

"Holding all the ASes: Identifying and Circumventing the Pitfalls of
  AS-aware Tor Client Design","  Traffic correlation attacks to de-anonymize Tor users are possible when an
adversary is in a position to observe traffic entering and exiting the Tor
network. Recent work has brought attention to the threat of these attacks by
network-level adversaries (e.g., Autonomous Systems). We perform a historical
analysis to understand how the threat from AS-level traffic correlation attacks
has evolved over the past five years. We find that despite a large number of
new relays added to the Tor network, the threat has grown. This points to the
importance of increasing AS-level diversity in addition to capacity of the Tor
network.
  We identify and elaborate on common pitfalls of AS-aware Tor client design
and construction. We find that succumbing to these pitfalls can negatively
impact three major aspects of an AS-aware Tor client -- (1) security against
AS-level adversaries, (2) security against relay-level adversaries, and (3)
performance. Finally, we propose and evaluate a Tor client -- Cipollino --
which avoids these pitfalls using state-of-the-art in network-measurement. Our
evaluation shows that Cipollino is able to achieve better security against
network-level adversaries while maintaining security against relay-level
adversaries and

"Efficiency Limits of Solar Energy Harvesting via Internal Photoemission
  in Carbon Materials","  We describe strategies to estimate the upper limits of the efficiency of
photon energy harvesting via hot electron extraction from gapless absorbers.
Gapless materials such as noble metals can be used for harvesting the whole
solar spectrum, including visible and near-infrared light. The energy of
photo-generated non-equilibrium or hot charge carriers can be harvested before
they thermalize with the crystal lattice via the process of their internal
photo-emission (IPE) through the rectifying Schottky junction with a
semiconductor. However, the low efficiency and the high cost of noble metals
necessitates the search for cheaper abundant alternative materials, and we show
here that carbon can serve as a promising IPE material candidate. We compare
the upper limits of performance of IPE photon energy-harvesting platforms,
which incorporate either gold or carbon as the photoactive material where hot
electrons are generated. Through a combination of density functional theory,
joint electron density of states calculations, and Schottky diode efficiency
modeling, we show that the material electron band structure imposes a strict
upper limit on the achievable efficiency of the IPE devices. Our calculations
reveal that graphite is a good material candidate for the IPE absorber for
harvesting visible and near-infrared photons. Graphite electron density of
states yields a sizeable population of hot electrons with energies high enough
to be collected across the potential barrier. We also discuss the mechanisms
that prevent the IPE device efficiency from reaching the upper limits imposed
by their material electron band structures. The proposed approach is general
and allows for efficient pre-screening of materials for their potential use in
IPE energy converters and photodetectors within application-specific spectral
windows.

"Producing the Deuteron in Stars: Anthropic Limits on Fundamental
  Constants","  Stellar nucleosynthesis proceeds via the deuteron (D), but only a small
change in the fundamental constants of nature is required to unbind it. Here,
we investigate the effect of altering the binding energy of the deuteron on
proton burning in stars. We find that the most definitive boundary in parameter
space that divides probably life-permitting universes from probably
life-prohibiting ones is between a bound and unbound deuteron. Due to neutrino
losses, a ball of gas will undergo rapid cooling or stabilization by electron
degeneracy pressure before it can form a stable, nuclear reaction-sustaining
star. We also consider a less-bound deuteron, which changes the energetics of
the $pp$ and $pep$ reactions. The transition to endothermic $pp$ and $pep$
reactions, and the resulting beta-decay instability of the deuteron, do not
seem to present catastrophic problems for life.

discuss the characterization of the stationary state as the solution of a

"Higher Order Elastic Instabilities of Metals: From Atom to Continuum
  Level","  Strain-based theory on elastic instabilities is being widely employed for
studying onset of plasticity, phase transition or melting in crystals. And size
effects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs to
account for contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient
based higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well
established to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids
directly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher
order elastic instabilities is established and justified by developing an
equivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical
instability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is
determined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain
gradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the
higher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be
directly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of
the stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals,
i.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression
technique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed
to study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted
critical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with the results from the
NEMD simulations for all the metals. Since the only inputs for the established
higher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations, i.e., atomic
potentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely
equivalent to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least,
for crystals.

Physical conditions for Jupiter-like dynamo models,"  The Juno mission will measure Jupiter's magnetic field with unprecedented
precision and provide a wealth of additional data that will allow to constrain
the planet's interior structure and dynamics. Here we analyse 66 numerical
simulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated
magnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model
VIP4 and up-to-date interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as
benchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like magnetic fields can be found for
a number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal gas or
use the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no
difference. However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads
to strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost
when the convective driving is too strong. The required intermediate range that
yields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties. The
second factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a
product of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We
find that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a good proxy for the top of
the dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole is
once more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to
Jupiter and the result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the
planetary radius.
  The zonal flows in our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely
confined to the molecular layer. Where the jet reaches down to higher
electrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega dynamo
that modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet. This
secondary dynamo can lead to strong magnetic field patches at low latitudes
that seem compatible with the VIP4 model.

Super-Nyquist asteroseismology with the Kepler Space Telescope,"  Barycentric corrections made to the timing of Kepler observations,
necessitated by variations in light arrival time at the satellite, break the
regular time-sampling of the data -- the time stamps are periodically
modulated. A consequence is that Nyquist aliases are split into multiplets that
can be identified by their shape. Real pulsation frequencies are
distinguishable from these aliases and their frequencies are completely
recoverable, even in the super-Nyquist regime, that is, when the sampling
interval is longer than half the pulsation period. We provide an analytical
derivation of the phenomenon, alongside demonstrations with simulated and real
Kepler data for \delta Sct, roAp, and sdBV stars. For Kepler data sets spanning
more than one Kepler orbital period (372.5 d), there are no Nyquist ambiguities
on the determination of pulsation frequencies, which are the fundamental data
of asteroseismology.

Benchmarking Fast-to-Alfven Mode Conversion in a Cold MHD Plasma,"  Alfv\'en waves may be generated via mode conversion from fast
magneto-acoustic waves near their reflection level in the solar atmosphere,
with implications both for coronal oscillations and for active region
helio-seismology. In active regions this reflection typically occurs high
enough that the Alfv\'en speed $a$ greatly exceeds the sound speed $c$, well
above the $a=c$ level where the fast and slow modes interact. In order to focus
on the fundamental characteristics of fast/Alfv\'en conversion, stripped of
unnecessary detail, it is therefore useful to freeze out the slow mode by
adopting the gravitationally stratified cold MHD model $c\to0$. This provides a
benchmark for fast-to-Alfv\'en mode conversion in more complex atmospheres.
Assuming a uniform inclined magnetic field and an exponential Alfv\'en speed
profile with density scale height $h$, the Alfv\'en conversion coefficient
depends on three variables only; the dimensionless
transverse-to-the-stratification wavenumber $\kappa=kh$, the magnetic field
inclination from the stratification direction $\theta$, and the polarization
angle $\phi$ of the wavevector relative to the plane containing the
stratification and magnetic field directions. We present an extensive
exploration of mode conversion in this parameter space and conclude that
near-total conversion to outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves typically occurs
for small $\theta$ and large $\phi$ ($80^\circ$--$90^\circ$), though it is
absent entirely when $\theta$ is exactly zero (vertical field). For wavenumbers
of helioseismic interest, the conversion region is broad enough to encompass
the whole chromosphere.

Squeezing of a nanomechanical oscillator,"  We show that squeezing of a nanomechanical mirror can be generated by
injecting broad band squeezed vacuum light and laser light into the cavity. We
work in the resolved sideband regime. We find that in order to obtain the
maximum momentum squeezing of the movable mirror, the squeezing parameter of
the input light should be about 1. We can obtain more than 70% squeezing.
Besides, for a fixed squeezing parameter, decreasing the temperature of the
environment or increasing the laser power increases the momentum squeezing. We
find very large squeezing with respect to thermal fluctuations, for instance at
1 mK, the momentum fluctuations go down by a factor more than one hundred.

Learning Graph Topological Features via GAN,"  Inspired by the generation power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in
image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning
characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via
GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both
local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input
graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate
reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the
associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces
subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early
reconstruction stages (unlike a single GAN, which cannot easily identify such
features, let alone reconstruct the original graph). This paper is firstline
research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.

"Limit theory for geometric statistics of point processes having fast
  decay of correlations","  Let $P$ be a simple,stationary point process having fast decay of
correlations, i.e., its correlation functions factorize up to an additive error
decaying faster than any power of the separation distance. Let $P_n:= P \cap
W_n$ be its restriction to windows $W_n:= [-{1 \over 2}n^{1/d},{1 \over
2}n^{1/d}]^d \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We consider the statistic $H_n^\xi:=
\sum_{x \in P_n}\xi(x,P_n)$ where $\xi(x,P_n)$ denotes a score function
representing the interaction of $x$ with respect to $P_n$. When $\xi$ depends
on local data in the sense that its radius of stabilization has an exponential
tail, we establish expectation asymptotics, variance asymptotics, and CLT for
$H_n^{\xi}$ and, more generally, for statistics of the re-scaled, possibly
signed, $\xi$-weighted point measures $\mu_n^{\xi} := \sum_{x \in P_n}
\xi(x,P_n) \delta_{n^{-1/d}x}$, as $W_n \uparrow \mathbb{R}^d$. This gives the
limit theory for non-linear geometric statistics (such as clique counts,
intrinsic volumes of the Boolean model, and total edge length of the
$k$-nearest neighbors graph) of $\alpha$-determinantal point processes having
fast decreasing kernels extending the CLTs of Soshnikov (2002) to non-linear
statistics. It also gives the limit theory for geometric U-statistics of
$\alpha$-permanental point processes and the zero set of Gaussian entire
functions, extending the CLTs of Nazarov and Sodin (2012) and Shirai and
Takahashi (2003), which are also confined to linear statistics. The proof of
the central limit theorem relies on a factorial moment expansion originating in
Blaszczyszyn (1995), Blaszczyszyn, Merzbach, Schmidt (1997) to show the fast
decay of the correlations of $\xi$-weighted point measures. The latter property
is shown to imply a condition equivalent to Brillinger mixing and consequently
yields the CLT for $\mu_n^\xi$ via an extension of the cumulant method.

Compositories and Gleaves,"  Sheaves are objects of a local nature: a global section is determined by how
it looks locally. Hence, a sheaf cannot describe mathematical structures which
contain global or nonlocal geometric information. To fill this gap, we
introduce the theory of ""gleaves"", which are presheaves equipped with an
additional ""gluing operation"" of compatible pairs of local sections. This
generalizes the conditional product structures of Dawid and Studen\'y, which
correspond to gleaves on distributive lattices. Our examples include the gleaf
of metric spaces and the gleaf of joint probability distributions. A result of
Johnstone shows that a category of gleaves can have a subobject classifier
despite not being cartesian closed.
  Gleaves over the simplex category $\Delta$, which we call compositories, can
be interpreted as a new kind of higher category in which the composition of an
$m$-morphism and an $n$-morphism along a common $k$-morphism face results in an
$(m+n-k)$-morphism. The distinctive feature of this composition operation is
that the original morphisms can be recovered from the composite morphism as
initial and final faces. Examples of compositories include nerves of categories
and compositories of higher spans.

The thickness of amalgamations of graphs,"  The thickness $\theta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of planar
spanning subgraphs into which the graph $G$ can be decomposed. As a topological
invariant of a graph, it is a measurement of the closeness to planarity of a
graph, and it also has important applications to VLSI design. In this paper,
the thickness of graphs that are obtained by vertex-amalgamation and
bar-amalgamation of any two graphs whose thicknesses are known are obtained,
respectively. And the lower and upper bounds for the thickness of graphs that
are obtained by edge-amalgamation and 2-vertex-amalgamation of any two graphs
whose thicknesses are known are also derived, respectively.

"A Distinguisher-Based Attack of a Homomorphic Encryption Scheme Relying
  on Reed-Solomon Codes","  Bogdanov and Lee suggested a homomorphic public-key encryption scheme based
on error correcting codes. The underlying public code is a modified
Reed-Solomon code obtained from inserting a zero submatrix in the Vandermonde
generating matrix defining it. The columns that define this submatrix are kept
secret and form a set $L$. We give here a distinguisher that detects if one or
several columns belong to $L$ or not. This distinguisher is obtained by
considering the code generated by component-wise products of codewords of the
public code (the so called ""square code""). This operation is applied to
punctured versions of this square code obtained by picking a subset
  $I$ of the whole set of columns. It turns out that the dimension of the
punctured square code is directly related to the cardinality of the
intersection of $I$ with $L$. This allows an attack which recovers the full set
$L$ and which can then decrypt any ciphertext.

Expert PC Troubleshooter With Fuzzy-Logic And Self-Learning Support,"  Expert systems use human knowledge often stored as rules within the computer
to solve problems that generally would entail human intelligence. Today, with
information systems turning out to be more pervasive and with the myriad
advances in information technologies, automating computer fault diagnosis is
becoming so fundamental that soon every enterprise has to endorse it. This
paper proposes an expert system called Expert PC Troubleshooter for diagnosing
computer problems. The system is composed of a user interface, a rule-base, an
inference engine, and an expert interface. Additionally, the system features a
fuzzy-logic module to troubleshoot POST beep errors, and an intelligent agent
that assists in the knowledge acquisition process. The proposed system is meant
to automate the maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) process, and free-up
human technicians from manually performing routine, laborious, and
timeconsuming maintenance tasks. As future work, the proposed system is to be
parallelized so as to boost its performance and speed-up its various
operations.

$\Lambda _{c}^{+}(2940)$ photoproduction off the neutron,"  By assuming that the $\Lambda _{c}^{\ast }(2940)$ is a $pD^{\ast 0}$
molecular state with spin-parity $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{+}$ and
$J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$, the photoproduction of charmed $\Lambda _{c}^{\ast
}(2940)$ baryon in the $\gamma n\rightarrow D^{-}\Lambda _{c}^{\ast
}(2940)^{+}$ process is investigated with an effective Lagrangian approach. It
is found that the contributions from $t$-channel with $D^{\ast }$ exchange are
dominant, while the $s$-channel with nucleon pole exchange give a sizeable
contribution around the threshold. The contributions from the $u$-channel and
contact term are very small. The total cross section of the $\gamma
n\rightarrow D^{-}\Lambda _{c}^{\ast }(2940)^{+}$ reaction is estimated, which
indicate it is feasible to searching for the charmed $\Lambda _{c}^{\ast

  Distribution","  The t-distribution has many useful applications in robust statistical
analysis. The parameter estimation of the t-distribution is carried out using
ML estimation method, and the ML estimates are obtained via the EM algorithm.

We adapt the EM algorithm to obtain the MLq estimates for all the parameters.
We provide a small simulation study to illustrate the performance of the MLq
estimators over the ML estimators and observe that the MLq estimators have
considerable superiority over the ML estimators.

Dong \textit{et al}. have observed a $T^{1.5}$ dependence of resistivity $\rho$
in KFe$_2$As$_2$ at the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ = 5 T parallel to the c

constitute evidence for a QCP and that recent dHvA results do not support the
proposed QCP.

"Contribution to Temporal Fault Tree Analysis without Modularization and
  Transformation into the State Space","  Background:
  Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a well established method for qualitative as
well as probabilistic reliability and safety analysis. As a Boolean model it
does not support modelling of dynamic effects like sequence dependencies
between fault events. This work describes a method that allows consideration of
sequence dependencies without transformations into state-space.
  Concept:
  The new temporal fault tree analysis (TFTA) described in this work extends
the Boolean FTA. The TFTA is based on a new temporal logic which adds a concept
of time to the Boolean logic and algebra. This allows modelling of temporal
relationships between events using two new temporal operators (PAND and SAND).
With a set of temporal logic rules, a given temporal term may be simplified to
its temporal disjunctive normal form (TDNF) which is similar to the Boolean DNF
but includes event sequencies. In TDNF the top event's temporal system function
may be reduced to a list of minimal cutset sequences (MCSS). These allow
qualitative analyses similar to Boolean cutset analysis in normal FTA.
Furthermore the TFTA may also be used for probabilistic analyses without using
state-space models.
  Results:
  One significant aspect of the new TFTA described in this work is the
possibility to take sequence dependencies into account for qualitative and
probabilistic analyses without state-space transformations. Among others, this
allows for modelling of event sequencies at all levels within a fault tree, a
real qualitative analysis similar to the FTA's cutset analysis, and
quantification of sequence dependencies within the same model.

The Slab Method to Measure the Topological Susceptibility,"  In simulations of a model with topological sectors, algorithms which proceed
in small update steps tend to get stuck in one sector, especially on fine
lattices. This distorts the numerical results; in particular it is not
straightforward to measure the topological susceptibility chi_t. We test a
method to measure chi_t even if configurations from only one sector are
available. It is based on the topological charges in sub-volumes, which we
denote as ""slab"". This enables the evaluation of chi_t, as we demonstrate with
numerical results for non-linear sigma-models and for 2-flavour QCD. In the
latter case, the gradient flow is applied for the smoothing of the gauge
configurations, and the slab method results for chi_t are stable over a broad
range of flow times.

Extinction time of the logistic process,"  The logistic birth and death process is perhaps the simplest stochastic
population model that has both density-dependent reproduction, and a phase
transition, and a lot can be learned about the process by studying its
extinction time, $\tau_n$, as a function of system size $n$. A number of
existing results describe the scaling of $\tau_n$ as $n\to\infty$, for various
choices of reproductive rate $r_n$ and initial population $X_n(0)$ as a
function of $n$. We collect and complete this picture, obtaining a complete
classification of all sequences $(r_n)$ and $(X_n(0))$ for which there exist
rescaling parameters $(s_n)$ and $(t_n)$ such that $(\tau_n-t_n)/s_n$ converges
in distribution as $n\to\infty$, and identifying the limits in each case.

"Ground state properties of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ determined from
  $\textit{ab initio}$ Hamiltonian and its extensions containing Kitaev and
  extended Heisenberg interactions","  We investigate the ground state properties of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ based on
numerical calculations of the recently proposed {\it ab initio} Hamiltonian
represented by Kitaev and extended Heisenberg interactions. To overcome the
limitation posed by small tractable system sizes in the exact diagonalization
study employed in a previous study (Yamaji $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett.
$\textbf{113}$, 107201 (2014)), we apply two-dimensional density matrix
renomalization group, and infinite-size tensor-network method. By calculating
at much larger system sizes, we critically test the validity of the exact
diagonalization results. The results consistently indicate that the ground
state of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ is a magnetically ordered state with zigzag
configuration in agreement with experimental observations and the previous
diagonalization study. Applications of the two independent methods in addition
to the exact diagonalization study further uncover a consistent and rich phase
diagram near the zigzag phase beyond the accessibility of the exact
diagonalization. For example, in the parameter space away from the $\textit{ab
initio}$ value of $\mathrm{Na_2IrO_3}$ controlled by the trigonal distortion,
we find three phases: (i) an ordered phase with the magnetic moment aligned
mutually in $120$ degrees orientation on every third hexagon, (ii) a
magnetically ordered phase with a $16$-site unit-cell, and (iii) an ordered
phase with presumably incommensurate periodicity of the moment. It suggests
that potentially rich magnetic structures may appear in
$A_\mathrm{2}\mathrm{IrO_3}$ compounds for $A$ other than Na. The present
results also serve to establish the accuracy of the first-principles approach
in reproducing the available experimental results thereby further contribute to
find a route to realize the Kitaev spin liquid.

"The Users' Perspective on the Privacy-Utility Trade-offs in Health
  Recommender Systems","  Privacy is a major good for users of personalized services such as
recommender systems. When applied to the field of health informatics, privacy
concerns of users may be amplified, but the possible utility of such services
is also high. Despite availability of technologies such as k-anonymity,
differential privacy, privacy-aware recommendation, and personalized privacy
trade-offs, little research has been conducted on the users' willingness to
share health data for usage in such systems. In two conjoint-decision studies
(sample size n=521), we investigate importance and utility of
privacy-preserving techniques related to sharing of personal health data for
k-anonymity and differential privacy. Users were asked to pick a preferred
sharing scenario depending on the recipient of the data, the benefit of sharing
data, the type of data, and the parameterized privacy. Users disagreed with
sharing data for commercial purposes regarding mental illnesses and with high
de-anonymization risks but showed little concern when data is used for
scientific purposes and is related to physical illnesses. Suggestions for
health recommender system development are derived from the findings.

"Theory of oxidation/reduction-induced chromium ion valence
  transformations in Cr,Ca:YAG crystals","  In their paper [Opt. Mater. 24, 333, 2003], Feldman et al conducted an
experimental study of the dynamics of chromium ion valence transformations in
Cr,Ca:YAG crystals among the trivalent Cr3+ state, and two tetravalent Cr4+
ones, of octahedral and tetrahedral coordination. The temperatures used ranged
between ~800 and 1,000 C. The basic effects are the transition of Cr3+ into
Cr4+ under high-temperature annealing in an oxidizing atmosphere, and the
reverse transition under a reducing atmosphere, or in vacuum. In the present
theory, we interpret the processes by oxygen-vacancy diffusion in the bulk of
the YAG. The quasi-chemical reaction VO2- + Cr4+ = Cr3+/VO- between the
chromium ions and the vacancies VO2- is responsible for the valence
transformations. Dynamical analysis provides profiles of the Cr3+ and Cr4+
concentrations in the crystal during oxidation and during reduction. Reaction
rate profiles are also calculated, establishing the reaction front position and
width. A comparison with existing experimental results on the integrated Cr4+
concentration as a function of time during oxidation [Opt. Mater. 24, 333,
2003] shows reasonable agreement.

application related to Langlands' beyond endoscopy proposal. It is motivated by
Ng\^o's suggestion that one combine nonabelian Fourier transforms with the
trace formula in order to prove the functional equations of Langlands
$L$-functions in general.

Liquid crystals of hard rectangles on flat and cylindrical manifolds,"  Using the classical density functional theory of freezing and Monte Carlo
computer simulations, we explore the liquid-crystalline phase behavior of hard
rectangles on flat and cylindrical manifolds. Moreover, we study the effect of
a static external field which couples to the rectangles' orientations, aligning
them towards a preferred direction. In the flat and field-free case, the bulk
phase diagram involves stable isotropic, nematic, tetratic, and smectic phases
depending on the aspect ratio and number density of the particles. The external
field shifts the transition lines significantly and generates a binematic phase
at the expense of the tetratic phase. On a cylindrical manifold, we observe
tilted smectic-like order, as obtained by wrapping a smectic layer around a
cylinder. We find in general good agreement between our density functional
calculations and particle-resolved computer simulations and mention possible
setups to verify our predictions in experiments.

The expected neutral frequency spectrum of linked sites,"  We present an exact, closed expression for the expected neutral Site
Frequency Spectrum for two neutral sites, 2-SFS, without recombination. This
spectrum is the immediate extension of the well known single site $\theta/f$
neutral SFS. Similar formulae are also provided for the case of the expected
SFS of sites that are linked to a focal neutral mutation of known frequency.
Formulae for finite samples are obtained by coalescent methods and remarkably
simple expressions are derived for the SFS of a large population, which are
also solutions of the multi-allelic Kolmogorov equations. Besides the general
interest of these new spectra, they relate to interesting biological cases such
as structural variants and introgressions. As an example, we present the
expected neutral frequency spectrum of regions with a chromosomal inversion.

A Computational Method for Sharp Interface Advection,"  We devise a numerical method for passive advection of a surface, such as the
interface between two incompressible fluids, across a computational mesh. The
method is called isoAdvector, and is developed for general meshes consisting of
arbitrary polyhedral cells. The algorithm is based on the volume of fluid (VOF)
idea of calculating the volume of one of the fluids transported across the mesh
faces during a time step. The novelty of the isoAdvector concept consists in
two parts: First, we exploit an isosurface concept for modelling the interface
inside cells in a geometric surface reconstruction step. Second, from the
reconstructed surface, we model the motion of the face-interface intersection
line for a general polygonal face to obtain the time evolution within a time
step of the submerged face area. Integrating this submerged area over the time
step leads to an accurate estimate for the total volume of fluid transported
across the face. The method was tested on simple 2D and 3D interface advection
problems both on structured and unstructured meshes. The results are very
satisfactory both in terms of volume conservation, boundedness, surface
sharpness, and efficiency. The isoAdvector method was implemented as an
OpenFOAM(R) extension and is published as open source.

"Studies of magnetogyration in cubic Bi12GeO20 crystals using
  small-angular magnetooptic polarimetry","  We present the results of studies for magnetogyration (MG) effect in
non-centro-symmetric, non-polar Bi12GeO20 crystals performed with the
small-angular polarimetric mapping technique. The magnitude of MG rotation
obtained with the small-angular mapping is close to the corresponding values
obtained recently on the basis of single-ray polarimetry. Our results
demonstrate that multiple reflections of light play a key role in the studies
of MG effect in Bi12GeO20 crystals. They lead to the error, which is at least
two times as large as the expected value of the MG rotation.

dark energy with variable $G$ in non-flat Kaluza$-$Klein universe. We consider
the non-interacting and interacting scenarios of the modified holographic dark
energy with dark matter and obtain the equation of state parameter through
logarithmic approach. It turns out that the universe remains in different dark
energy eras for both cases. Further, we study the validity of the generalized
second law of thermodynamics in this scenario. We also justify that the
statefinder parameters satisfy the limit of $\Lambda$CDM model.

  Study","  We use ab initio density functional theory to study the equilibrium geometry
and electronic structure of few-layer grey arsenic. In contrast to the bulk
structure that is semimetallic, few-layer grey As displays a significant band
gap that depends sensitively on the number of layers, in-layer strain, layer
stacking and inter-layer spacing. A metal-semiconductor transition can be
introduced by changing the number of layers or the in-layer strain. We
interpret this transition by an abrupt change in the spatial distribution of
electronic states near the top of the valence band.

"Alchymical Mirror: Real-time Interactive Sound- and Simple
  Motion-Tracking Set of Jitter/Max/MSP Patches","  This document supplements an experimental Jitter / Max/MSP collection of
implementation patches that set its goal to simulate an alchemical process for
a person standing in front of a mirror-like screen while interacting with it.
The work involved takes some patience and has three stages to go through. At
the final stage the ""alchemist"" in the mirror wearing sharp-colored gloves (for
motion tracking) is to extract the final ultimate shining sparkle (FFT-based
visualization) in the nexus of the hands. The more the hands are apart, the
large the sparkle should be. Moving hands around should make the sparkle
follow. To achieve the desired visual effect and the feedback mechanism, the
Jitter lattice-based intensional programming model is used to work on
4-dimensional (A+R+G+B) video matrices and sound signals in order to apply some
well-known alchemical techniques to the video at real-time to get a mirror
effect and accompanying transmutation and transformation stages of the video
based on the stability of the sound produced for some duration of time in
real-time. There is an accompanying video of the result with the interaction
with the tool and the corresponding programming patches.

Scuti stars and one eclipsing binary in the open cluster NGC1817, and of ten
delta Scuti stars and two other variables in the open cluster NGC7062. For all
targets in NGC1817 and for three targets in NGC7062, the radial velocity and
projected rotational velocity are determined. For all stars, the effective
temperature and surface gravity is measured. Two delta Scuti stars, NGC1817-V1
and NGC7062-V1, and the eclipsing binary, NGC1817-V18, are discovered to be
single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The eclipsing binary delta Scuti star
NGC1817-V4 is discovered to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. All delta
Scuti stars which we observed spectroscopically are found to be moderate or
fast rotators.

Quantum entanglement of nanocantilevers,"  We propose a scheme to entangle two mechanical nanocantilevers through
indirect interactions mediated by a gas of ultra cold atoms. We envisage a
system of nanocantilevers magnetically coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of
atoms and focus on studying the dark states of the system. These dark states
are entangled states of the two nanocantilevers, with no coupling to the atomic
condensate. In the absence of dissipation, the degree of entanglement is found
to oscillate with time, while if dissipation is included, the system is found
to relax to a statistical mixture of dark states which remains time independent
until the inevitable thermal dephasing destroys the nanocantilever coherence.
This opens up the possibility of achieving long-lived entangled nanocantilever
states.

Extinction curve template for intrinsically reddened quasars,"  We analyze the near-infrared to UV data of 16 quasars with redshifts ranging
from 0.71 $<$ $z$ $<$ 2.13 to investigate dust extinction properties. The
sample presented in this work is obtained from the High $A_V$ Quasar (HAQ)
survey. The quasar candidates were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and follow-up
spectroscopy was carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the New
Technology Telescope (NTT). To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the
quasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). We derived the extinction curves using Fitzpatrick &
Massa 1986 (FM) law by comparing the observed SEDs to the combined quasar
template from Vanden Berk et al. 2001 and Glikman et al. 2006. The derived
extinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction
curves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a
weighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction
curve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean
values of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well
fit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\pm0.2$. The `average quasar
extinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction
curves at a confidence level $\gtrsim95\%$. Such steep extinction curves
suggest a significant population of silicates to produce small dust grains.
Moreover, another possibility could be that the large dust grains may have been
destroyed by the activity of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), resulting
in steep extinction curves.

Ethical Aspects of Internet of Things from Islamic Perspective,"  The Internet of Things (IoTs) is an evolving new face of technology that
provides state of the art services using ubiquitously connected smart objects.
These smart objects are capable of sensing, processing, collaborating,
communicating the events and provide services. The IoT is a collection of
heterogeneous technologies like Sensor, RFID, Communication and nanotechnology.
These technologies enable smart objects to identify objects, collect
information about their status,communicating the collected information for
taking some desired actions. Widespread adaptations of IoT based devices and
services raised the ethical challenges for their users. In this paper we
highlight ethical challenges raised by IoT and discuss the solutions and
methods for encouraging people to properly use these technologies according to
Islamic teachings.

near a circular aperture in a metal film of finite thickness and finite
conductivity. We have considered the metal film both suspended freely in vacuum
and lying on a substrate. A significant effect of molecule the position and the

is shown. The asymptotes which can be used to describe this process are found.
Total, radiative, and non-radiative spontaneous decay rates of the excited
molecule are extracted and compared. The results may be useful in the
development and interpretation of experiments investigating a single molecule
with a scanning optical microscope and in the design of optical nanodevices
based on the control of elementary quantum systems emission with a nanohole.

"Energy Spectrum of Local Multiparticle Configurations and Mechanism of
  Anomalously Slow Relaxation of the System of Strongly Interacting Liquid
  Clusters in a Disordered Nanoporous Medium According to the Self-Organized
  Criticality Scenario","  It has been shown that changes in the energy of a system of nonwetting-liquid
clusters confined in a random nanoporous medium in the process of relaxation
can be written in the quasiparticle approximation in the form of the sum of the
energies of local (metastable) configurations of liquid clusters interacting
with clusters in the connected nearest pores. The energy spectrum and density
of states of the local configuration have been calculated. It has been shown
that the relaxation of the state of the system occurs through the scenario of
self-organized criticality (SOC). The process is characterized by the
expectation of a fluctuation necessary for overcoming a local energy barrier of
the metastable state with the subsequent rapid hydrodynamic extrusion of the
liquid under the action of the surface buoyancy forces of the nonwetting
framework. In this case, the dependence of the interaction between local
configurations on the number of filled pores belonging to the infinite
percolation cluster of filled pores serves as an internal feedback initiating
the SOC process. The calculations give a power-law time dependence of the
relative volume of the confined liquid. The developed model of the relaxation
of the porous medium with the nonwetting liquid demonstrates possible
mechanisms and scenarios of SOC for disordered atomic systems.

"Inflation in exponential scalar model and finite-time singularity
  induced instability","  We investigate how a Type IV future singularity can be included in the
cosmological evolution of a well-known exponential model of inflation. In order
to achieve this we use a two scalar field model, in the context of which the
incorporation of the Type IV singularity can be consistently done. In the
context of the exponential model we study, when a Type IV singularity is
included in the evolution, an instability occurs in the slow-roll parameters,
and in particular on the second slow-roll parameter. Particularly, if we
abandon the slow-roll condition for both the scalars we shall use, then the
most consistent description of the dynamics of the inflationary era is provided
by the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\epsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$. Then, the second
Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$, which measures the duration of the
inflationary era, becomes singular at the point where the Type IV singularity
is chosen to occur, while the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$ is
regular there. Therefore, this infinite singularity indicates that the
occurrence of the finite-time singularity is responsible for the instability in
the scalar field model we study. This sort of instability has it's imprint on
the dynamical system that can be constructed from the cosmological equations,
with the dynamical system being unstable. In addition, the instability due to
the singularity mechanism we propose, is discussed in the context of other
inflationary scalar potentials. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a
singularity in the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we also critically discuss
qualitatively, what implications could this effect have on the graceful exit
problem of the exponential model.

"Efficient metallic spintronic emitters of ultrabroadband terahertz
  radiation","  Terahertz electromagnetic radiation is extremely useful for numerous
applications such as imaging and spectroscopy. Therefore, it is highly
desirable to have an efficient table-top emitter covering the 1-to-30-THz
window whilst being driven by a low-cost, low-power femtosecond laser
oscillator. So far, all solid-state emitters solely exploit physics related to
the electron charge and deliver emission spectra with substantial gaps. Here,
we take advantage of the electron spin to realize a conceptually new terahertz
source which relies on tailored fundamental spintronic and photonic phenomena
in magnetic metal multilayers: ultrafast photo-induced spin currents, the
inverse spin-Hall effect and a broadband Fabry-P\'erot resonance. Guided by an
analytical model, such spintronic route offers unique possibilities for
systematic optimization. We find that a 5.8-nm-thick W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer
generates ultrashort pulses fully covering the 1-to-30-THz range. Our novel
source outperforms laser-oscillator-driven emitters such as ZnTe(110) crystals
in terms of bandwidth, terahertz-field amplitude, flexibility, scalability and
cost.

"Self-organization in the tornado: the new approach in the tornado
  description","  For the mathematical modeling of highly non-equilibrium and nonlinear
processes in a tornado in this paper a new approach based on nonlinear
equations of momentum transfer with function of sources and sinks is suggested.
In constructing the model thermodynamic description is used, which is not
entered before and allows discovering new principles of self-organization in a
tornado. This approach gives fairly consistent physical results. This is an
attempt to answer some fundamental questions concerning the existence of a
tornado based on the created model and numerical results.

"Thermometry of ultracold fermions by (super)lattice modulation
  spectroscopy","  We theoretically consider non-interacting fermions confined to optical
lattices and apply a lattice amplitude modulation that we choose to be either
homogeneous or of superlattice geometry. We study the atom excitation rate to
higher Bloch bands which can be measured by adiabatic band mapping. We find
that the atom excitation rate shows a clear signature of the temperature
dependent Fermi distribution in the lowest band of the equilibrium lattice as
excitations are quasimomentum-resolved. Based on typical experimental
parameters and incorporating a trapping potential, we find that thermometry of
one- and two-dimensional systems is within the reach of nowadays experiments.
Our scheme is valid down to temperatures of a few percent of the hopping
amplitude comparable to the N\'eel temperature in interacting systems.

"Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European
  languages in Europe","  We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000
years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost four
hundred thousand polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the
sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around
250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than
previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the
populations of western and far eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories
between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in
Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers
appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous
hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of
hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6 . By
~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred
throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this
time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European
hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and
Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded
Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,
documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern
periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans
until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans.
These results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least
some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.

Improved distance determination to M51 from supernovae 2011dh and 2005cs,"  The appearance of two recent supernovae, SN 2011dh and 2005cs, both in M51,
provides an opportunity to derive an improved distance to their host galaxy by
combining the observations of both SNe. We apply the Expanding Photosphere
Method to get the distance to M51 by fitting the data of these two SNe
simultaneously. In order to correct for the effect of flux dilution, we use
correction factors (zeta) appropriate for standard type II-P SNe atmospheres
for 2005cs, but find zeta ~ 1 for the type IIb SN 2011dh, which may be due to
the reduced H-content of its ejecta. The EPM analysis resulted in D_M51 = 8.4
+/- 0.7 Mpc. Based on this improved distance, we also re-analyze the HST
observations of the proposed progenitor of SN 2011dh. We confirm that the
object detected on the pre-explosion HST-images is unlikely to be a compact
stellar cluster. In addition, its derived radius (~ 277$ R_sun) is too large
for being the real (exploded) progenitor of SN 2011dh. The supernova-based
distance, D = 8.4 Mpc, is in good agreement with other recent distance
estimates to M51.

"Probing Galactic Structure with the Spatial Correlation Function of
  SEGUE G-dwarf Stars","  We measure the two-point correlation function of G-dwarf stars within 1-3 kpc
of the Sun in multiple lines-of-sight using the Schlesinger et al. G-dwarf
sample from the SDSS SEGUE survey. The shapes of the correlation functions
along individual SEGUE lines-of-sight depend sensitively on both the
stellar-density gradients and the survey geometry. We fit smooth disk galaxy
models to our SEGUE clustering measurements, and obtain strong constraints on
the thin- and thick-disk components of the Milky Way. Specifically, we
constrain the values of the thin- and thick-disk scale heights with 3% and 2%
precision, respectively, and the values of the thin- and thick-disk scale
lengths with 20% and 8% precision, respectively. Moreover, we find that a
two-disk model is unable to fully explain our clustering measurements, which
exhibit an excess of clustering at small scales (< 50 pc). This suggests the
presence of small-scale substructure in the disk system of the Milky Way.

Renegade Subhaloes in the Local Group,"  Using a dark matter only Constrained Local UniversE Simulation (CLUES) we
examine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one of
the two prominent hosts in the Local Group (i.e. the Milky Way and the
Andromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects ""renegade subhaloes"". In
light of recent claims that the two Magellanic Clouds (MCs) may have originated
from another region (or even the outskirts) of the Local Group or that they
have been spawned by a major merger in the past of the Andromeda galaxy, we
investigate the nature of such events. However, we cannot confirm that renegade
subhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor that
they share the most simplest properties with the MCs, namely mass and relative
velocity. Our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appear
to be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. A merger is not
required to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of our
simulated Local Group facilitating such behavior. Since just a small fraction
of the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that it
will be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differences
in their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

"Perturbative traveling wave solution for a flux-limited
  reaction-diffusion morphogenesis equation","  In this study, we investigate a porous medium-type flux limited
reaction--diffusion equation that arises in morphogenesis modeling. This
nonlinear partial differential equation is an extension of the generalized
Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovsky--Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation in

found by using a perturbation method. We show that the morphogen concentration
propagates as a sharp wave front where the wave speed has a saturated value.
The numerical solutions of this equation are also provided to compare them with
the analytical predictions. Finally, we qualitatively compare our theoretical
results with those obtained in experimental studies.

formulated explicitly in terms of operators, which are invariant under the

natural truncation of the functional driving the renormalisation flow of the
potential of the three-flavor case ($U(3)\times U(3)$). The procedure applied
to the $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ symmetric theory, results in an equation, which
potentially allows an RG-investigation of the effect of the 't Hooft term
representing the $U_A(1)$ anomaly, disentangled from the other operators.

CPL: A Core Language for Cloud Computing -- Technical Report,"  Running distributed applications in the cloud involves deployment. That is,
distribution and configuration of application services and middleware
infrastructure. The considerable complexity of these tasks resulted in the
emergence of declarative JSON-based domain-specific deployment languages to
develop deployment programs. However, existing deployment programs unsafely
compose artifacts written in different languages, leading to bugs that are hard
to detect before run time. Furthermore, deployment languages do not provide
extension points for custom implementations of existing cloud services such as
application-specific load balancing policies.
  To address these shortcomings, we propose CPL (Cloud Platform Language), a
statically-typed core language for programming both distributed applications as
well as their deployment on a cloud platform. In CPL, application services and
deployment programs interact through statically typed, extensible interfaces,
and an application can trigger further deployment at run time. We provide a
formal semantics of CPL and demonstrate that it enables type-safe, composable
and extensible libraries of service combinators, such as load balancing and
fault tolerance.

"Shaping nanoparticle fingerprints at the interface of cholesteric
  droplets","  The ordering of nanoparticles into predetermined configurations is of
importance to the design of advanced technologies. In this work, we moderate
the surface anchoring against the bulk elasticity of liquid crystals to
dynamically shape nanoparticle assemblies at a fluid interface. By tuning the
degree of nanoparticle hydrophobicity with surfactants that alter the molecular
anchoring of liquid crystals, we pattern nanoparticles at the interface of
cholesteric liquid crystal emulsions. Adjusting the particle hydrophobicity
more finely further modifies the rigidity of assemblies. We establish that
patterns are tunable by varying both surfactant and chiral dopant
concentrations. Since particle assembly occurs at the interface with the
desired structures exposed to the surrounding phase, we demonstrate that
particles can be readily crosslinked and manipulated, forming structures that
retain their shape under external perturbations. This study establishes the
templating of nanomaterials into reconfigurable arrangements. Interfacial
assembly is tempered by elastic patterns that arise from the geometric
frustration of confined cholesterics. This work serves as a basis for creating
materials with chemical heterogeneity and with linear, periodic structures,
essential for optical and energy applications.

Magnetotransport properties of individual InAs nanowires,"  We probe the magnetotransport properties of individual InAs nanowires in a
field effect transistor geometry. In the low magnetic field regime we observe
magnetoresistance that is well described by the weak localization (WL)
description in diffusive conductors. The weak localization correction is
modified to weak anti-localization (WAL) as the gate voltage is increased. We
show that the gate voltage can be used to tune the phase coherence length
($l_\phi$) and spin-orbit length ($l_{so}$) by a factor of $\sim$ 2. In the
high field and low temperature regime we observe the mobility of devices can be
modified significantly as a function of magnetic field. We argue that the role
of skipping orbits and the nature of surface scattering is essential in
understanding high field magnetotransport in nanowires.

Here we discuss considerations analogous to MFV in the context of
$SU(5)$-unification, showing the new effects/constraints that arise both in the
quark as in the lepton sector, where quantitative statements can be made
controlled by the CKM matrix elements. The case of supersymmetry is examined in
detail as a particularly motivated example. Third generation sleptons and
neutralinos in the few hundred GeV range are shown to be compatible with
current constraints.

Roots of unity in definite quaternion orders,"  A commutative order in a quaternion algebra is called selective if it is

that a given quadratic order over a number field can be selective in at most

cubic root of unity is selective for any definite quaternion algebra over the
rationals with a type number 3 or larger. The proof extends to a few other
closely related orders.

Optimal classical simulation of state-independent quantum contextuality,"  Simulating quantum contextuality with classical systems requires memory. A
fundamental yet open question is what is the minimum memory needed and,
therefore, the precise sense in which quantum systems outperform classical
ones. Here, we make rigorous the notion of classically simulating quantum
state-independent contextuality (QSIC) in the case of a single quantum system
submitted to an infinite sequence of measurements randomly chosen from a finite
QSIC set. We obtain the minimum memory needed to simulate arbitrary QSIC sets
via classical systems under the assumption that the simulation should not
contain any oracular information. In particular, we show that, while
classically simulating two qubits tested with the Peres-Mermin set requires
$\log_2 24 \approx 4.585$ bits, simulating a single qutrit tested with the
Yu-Oh set requires, at least, $5.740$ bits.

"Bondi or not Bondi: the impact of resolution on accretion and drag force
  modelling for Supermassive Black Holes","  Whilst in galaxy-size simulations, supermassive black holes (SMBH) are
entirely handled by sub-grid algorithms, computational power now allows the
accretion radius of such objects to be resolved in smaller scale simulations.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of resolution on two commonly used
SMBH sub-grid algorithms; the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) formula for accretion
onto a point mass, and the related estimate of the drag force exerted onto a
point mass by a gaseous medium. We find that when the accretion region around
the black hole scales with resolution, and the BHL formula is evaluated using
local mass-averaged quantities, the accretion algorithm smoothly transitions
from the analytic BHL formula (at low resolution) to a supply limited accretion
(SLA) scheme (at high resolution). However, when a similar procedure is
employed to estimate the drag force it can lead to significant errors in its
magnitude, and/or apply this force in the wrong direction in highly resolved
simulations. At high Mach numbers and for small accretors, we also find
evidence of the advective-acoustic instability operating in the adiabatic case,
and of an instability developing around the wake's stagnation point in the
quasi-isothermal case. Moreover, at very high resolution, and Mach numbers
above $\mathcal{M}_\infty \geq 3$, the flow behind the accretion bow shock
becomes entirely dominated by these instabilities. As a result, accretion rates
onto the black hole drop by about an order of magnitude in the adiabatic case,
compared to the analytic BHL formula.

Inhomogeneous vacuum energy,"  Vacuum energy remains the simplest model of dark energy which could drive the
accelerated expansion of the Universe without necessarily introducing any new
degrees of freedom. Inhomogeneous vacuum energy is necessarily interacting in
general relativity. Although the four-velocity of vacuum energy is undefined,
an interacting vacuum has an energy transfer and the vacuum energy defines a
particular foliation of spacetime with spatially homogeneous vacuum energy in
cosmological solutions. It is possible to give a consistent description of
vacuum dynamics and in particular the relativistic equations of motion for
inhomogeneous perturbations given a covariant prescription for the vacuum
energy, or equivalently the energy transfer four-vector, and we construct
gauge-invariant vacuum perturbations. We show that any dark energy cosmology
can be decomposed into an interacting vacuum+matter cosmology whose
inhomogeneous perturbations obey simple first-order equations.

"Mesoscopic Kinetic Basis of Macroscopic Chemical Thermodynamics: A
  Mathematical Theory","  From a mathematical model that describes a complex chemical kinetic system of
$N$ species and $M$ elementrary reactions in a rapidly stirred vessel of size
$V$ as a Markov process, we show that a macroscopic chemical thermodynamics
emerges as $V\rightarrow\infty$. The theory is applicable to linear and
nonlinear reactions, closed systems reaching chemical equilibrium, or open,
driven systems approaching to nonequilibrium steady states. A generalized
mesoscopic free energy gives rise to a macroscopic chemical energy function
$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$ where $\vx=(x_1,\cdots,x_N)$ are the concentrations of the
$N$ chemical species. The macroscopic chemical dynamics $\vx(t)$ satisfies two
emergent laws: (1) $(\rd/\rd t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]\le 0$, and (2)$(\rd/\rd
t)\varphi^{ss}[\vx(t)]=\text{cmf}(\vx)-\sigma(\vx)$ where entropy production
rate $\sigma\ge 0$ represents the sink for the chemical energy, and chemical
motive force $\text{cmf}\ge 0$ is non-zero if the system is driven under a
sustained nonequilibrium chemostat. For systems with detailed balance
$\text{cmf}=0$, and if one assumes the law of mass action,$\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$
is precisely the Gibbs' function $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\mu_i^o+\ln x_i\big]$
for ideal solutions. For a class of kinetic systems called complex balanced,
which include many nonlinear systems as well as many simple open, driven
chemical systems, the $\varphi^{ss}(\vx)$, with global minimum at $\vx^*$, has
the generic form $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\big[\ln(x_i/x_i^*)-x_i+x_i^*\big]$,which has
been known in chemical kinetic literature.Macroscopic emergent ""laws"" are
independent of the details of the underlying kinetics. This theory provides a
concrete example from chemistry showing how a dynamic macroscopic law can
emerge from the kinetics at a level below.

"Tree Diagram Lie Algebras of Differential Operators and Evolution
  Partial Differential Equations","  A tree diagram is a tree with positive integral weight on each edge, which is
a notion generalized from the Dynkin diagrams of finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras. We introduce two nilpotent Lie algebras and their extended solvable
Lie algebras associated with each tree diagram. The solvable tree diagram Lie
algebras turn out to be complete Lie algebras of maximal rank analogous to the
Borel subalgebras of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Their abelian
ideals are completely determined. Using a high-order Campbell-Hausdorff formula
and certain abelian ideals of the tree diagram Lie algebras, we solve the
initial value problem of first-order evolution partial differential equations
associated with nilpotent tree diagram Lie algebras and high-order evolution
partial differential equations, including heat conduction type equations
related to generalized Tricomi operators associated with trees.

"Challenges of Profile Likelihood Evaluation in Multi-Dimensional SUSY
  Scans","  Statistical inference of the fundamental parameters of supersymmetric
theories is a challenging and active endeavor. Several sophisticated algorithms
have been employed to this end. While Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
nested sampling techniques are geared towards Bayesian inference, they have
also been used to estimate frequentist confidence intervals based on the
profile likelihood ratio. We investigate the performance and appropriate
configuration of MultiNest, a nested sampling based algorithm, when used for
profile likelihood-based analyses both on toy models and on the parameter space
of the Constrained MSSM. We find that while the standard configuration is
appropriate for an accurate reconstruction of the Bayesian posterior, the
profile likelihood is poorly approximated. We identify a more appropriate
MultiNest configuration for profile likelihood analyses, which gives an
excellent exploration of the profile likelihood (albeit at a larger
computational cost), including the identification of the global maximum
likelihood value. We conclude that with the appropriate configuration MultiNest
is a suitable tool for profile likelihood studies, indicating previous claims
to the contrary are not well founded.

"Convergence of time averages of weak solutions of the three-dimensional
  Navier-Stokes equations","  Using the concept of stationary statistical solution, which generalizes the
notion of invariant measure, it is proved that, in a suitable sense, time
averages of almost every Leray-Hopf weak solution of the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge as the averaging time goes to
infinity. This system of equations is not known to be globally well-posed, and
the above result answers a long-standing problem, extending to this system a
classical result from ergodic theory. It is also showed that, from a
measure-theoretic point of view, the stationary statistical solution obtained
from a generalized limit of time averages is independent of the choice of the
generalized limit. Finally, any Borel subset of the phase space with positive
measure with respect to a stationary statistical solution is such that for
almost all initial conditions in that Borel set and for at least one Leray-Hopf
weak solution starting with that initial condition, the corresponding orbit is
recurrent to that Borel subset and its mean sojourn time within that Borel
subset is strictly positive.

Masking line foregrounds in intensity mapping surveys,"  We address the problem of line confusion in intensity mapping surveys and
explore the possibility to mitigate line foreground contamination by
progressively masking the brightest pixels in the observed map. We consider
experiments targeting CO(1-0) at $z=3$, Ly$\alpha$ at $z=7$, and CII at $z=7$,
and use simulated intensity maps, which include both clustering and shot noise
components of the signal and possible foregrounds, in order to test the
efficiency of our method. We find that for CO and Ly$\alpha$ it is quite
possible to remove most of the foreground contribution from the maps via only
1%-3% pixel masking. The CII maps will be more difficult to clean, however, due
to instrumental constraints and the high-intensity foreground contamination
involved. While the masking procedure sacrifices much of the astrophysical
information present in our maps, we demonstrate that useful cosmological
information in the targeted lines can be successfully retrieved.

Neural Models for Documents with Metadata,"  Most real-world document collections involve various types of metadata, such
as author, source, and date, and yet the most commonly-used approaches to
modeling text corpora ignore this information. While specialized models have
been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as
customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In
this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and
propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible
incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative
models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff
between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the
potential of our framework through an exploration of a corpus of articles about
US immigration.

"Interplay between endogenous and exogenous fluctuations in financial
  markets","  We address microscopic, agent based, and macroscopic, stochastic, modeling of
the financial markets combining it with the exogenous noise. The interplay
between the endogenous dynamics of agents and the exogenous noise is the
primary mechanism responsible for the observed long-range dependence and
statistical properties of high volatility return intervals. By exogenous noise
we mean information flow or/and order flow fluctuations. Numerical results
based on the proposed model reveal that the exogenous fluctuations have to be
considered as indispensable part of comprehensive modeling of the financial
markets.

Sivers Function in the Quasi-Classical Approximation,"  We calculate the Sivers function in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
(SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process (DY) by employing the quasi-classical
Glauber-Mueller/ McLerran-Venugopalan approximation. Modeling the hadron as a
large ""nucleus"" with non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM), we find that its
Sivers function receives two dominant contributions: one contribution is due to
the OAM, while another one is due to the local Sivers function density in the
nucleus. While the latter mechanism, being due to the ""lensing"" interactions,
dominates at large transverse momentum of the produced hadron in SIDIS or of
the di-lepton pair in DY, the former (OAM) mechanism is leading in saturation
power counting and dominates when the above transverse momenta become of the
order of the saturation scale. We show that the OAM channel allows for a
particularly simple and intuitive interpretation of the celebrated sign flip
between the Sivers functions in SIDIS and DY.

"Semi-local density functional for the exchange-correlation energy of
  electrons in two dimensions","  We present a practical and accurate density functional for the
exchange-correlation energy of electrons in two dimensions. The exchange part
is based on a recent two-dimensional generalized-gradient approximation derived
by considering the limits of small and large density gradients. The fully local
correlation part is constructed following the Colle-Salvetti scheme and a
Gaussian approximation for the pair density. The combination of these
expressions is shown to provide an efficient density functional to calculate
the total energies of two-dimensional electron systems such as semiconductor
quantum dots. Excellent performance of the functional with respect to
numerically exact reference data for quantum dots is demonstrated.

"Star formation in low density HI gas around the Elliptical Galaxy
  NGC2865","  Interacting galaxies surrounded by HI tidal debris are ideal sites for the
study of young clusters and tidal galaxy formation. The process that triggers
star formation in the low-density environments outside galaxies is still an
open question. New clusters and galaxies of tidal origin are expected to have
high metallicities for their luminosities. Spectroscopy of such objects is,
however, at the limit of what can be done with existing 8-10m class telescopes,
which has prevented statistical studies of these objects. NGC2865 is an
UV-bright merging elliptical galaxy with shells and extended HI tails. The
regions observed in this work were previously detected using multi-slit imaging
spectroscopy. We obtain new multislit spectroscopy of six young star-forming
regions around NGC2865, to determine their redshifts and metallicities. The six
emission-line regions are located 16-40 kpc from NGC2865 and they have similar
redshifts. They have ages of ~10Myears and an average metallicity of
12+log(O/H) ~ 8.6, suggesting a tidal origin for the regions. It is noted that
they coincide with an extended HI tail, which has projected density of N$_{HI}$
< 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and displays a low surface brightness counterpart. These
regions may represent the youngest of the three populations of star clusters
already identified in NGC2865. The high, nearly-solar, oxygen abundances found
for the six regions in the vicinity of NGC2865 suggest that they were formed by
pre-enriched material from the parent galaxy, from gas removed during the last
major merger. Given the mass and the location of the HII regions, we can
speculate that these young star-forming regions are potential precursors of
globular clusters that will be part of the halo of NGC2865 in the future. Our
result supports the use of the multi-slit imaging spectroscopy as a useful tool
for finding nearly-formed stellar systems around galaxies.

"Was a cloud-cloud collision the trigger of the recent star formation in
  Serpens?","  The complexity of the ISM is such that it is unlikely that star formation is
initiated in the same way in all molecular clouds. While some clouds seem to
collapse on their own, others may be triggered by an external event such as a
cloud/flow collision forming a gravitationally unstable enhanced density layer.
This work tests cloud-cloud collisions as the triggering mechanism for star
formation in the Serpens Main Cluster as has been suggested by previous work. A
set of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the collision
between two cylindrical clouds are performed and compared to (sub)millimetre
observations of the Serpens Main Cluster. A configuration has been found which
reproduces many of the observed characteristics of Serpens, including some of
the main features of the peculiar velocity field. The evolution of the velocity
with position throughout the model is similar to that observed and the column
density and masses within the modeled cloud agree with those measured for the
SE sub-cluster. Furthermore, our results also show that an asymmetric collision
provides the ingredients to reproduce lower density filaments perpendicular to
the main structure, similar to those observed. In this scenario, the formation
of the NW sub-cluster of Serpens can be reproduced only if there is a
pre-existing marginally gravitationally unstable region at the time the
collision occurs. This work supports the interpretation that a collision
between two clouds may have been the trigger of the most recent burst of star
formation in Serpens. It not only explains the complicated velocity structure
seen in the region, but also the temperature differences between the north (in
""isolated"" collapse) and the south (resulting from the shock between the
clouds). In addition it provides an explanation for the sources in the south
having a larger spread in age than those in the north.

"A method to identify potential ambiguous Malay words through Ambiguity
  Attributes mapping: An exploratory Study","  We describe here a methodology to identify a list of ambiguous Malay words
that are commonly being used in Malay documentations such as Requirement
Specification. We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality
attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come
out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The
extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the
constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then
verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of
potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid
using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well
as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list
of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing
Malay sentences

ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda
et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined.
  The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with
closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains
almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (sigma intrinsic = 0.20
dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life;
specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V
velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning
thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters
for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

"Wave propagation in linear viscoelastic media with completely monotonic
  relaxation moduli","  It is shown that viscoelastic wave dispersion and attenuation in a
viscoelastic medium with a completely monotonic relaxation modulus is
completely characterized by the phase speed and the dispersion-attenuation
spectral measure. The dispersion and attenuation functions are expressed in
terms of a single dispersion-attenuation spectral measure. An alternative
expression of the mutual dependence of the dispersion and attenuation
functions, known as the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, is also derived
from the theory. The minimum phase aspect of the filters involved in the
Green's function is another consequence of the theory. Explicit integral
expressions for the attenuation and dispersion functions are obtained for a few
analytical relaxation models.

number-theoretic transformation $T$ if and only if $x$ is normal with respect
to $T^n$ for any $n\ge 1$. This corrects an erroneous proof of Schweiger. Then,
using some insights from Schweiger's original proof, we extend these results,
showing for example that a number is normal with respect to the regular
continued fraction expansion if and only if it is normal with respect to the
odd continued fraction expansion.

Superradiance induced particle flow via dynamical gauge coupling,"  We study fermions that are gauge-coupled to a cavity mode via Raman-assisted
hopping in a one dimensional lattice. For an infinite lattice, we find a
superradiant phase with infinitesimal pumping threshold which induces a
directed particle flow. We explore the fate of this flow in a finite lattice
with boundaries, studying the non-equilibrium dynamics including fluctuation
effects. The short time dynamics is dominated by superradiance, while the long
time behaviour is governed by cavity fluctuations. We show that the steady
state in the finite lattice is not unique, and can be understood in terms of
coherent bosonic excitations above a Fermi surface in real space.

"Accelerated 2D magnetic resonance spectroscopy of single spins using
  matrix completion","  Two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the
major tools for analysing the chemical structure of organic molecules and
proteins. Despite its power, this technique requires long measurement times,
which, particularly in the recently emerging diamond based single molecule NMR,
limits its application to stable samples. Here we demonstrate a method which
allows to obtain the spectrum by collecting only a small fraction of the
experimental data. Our method is based on matrix completion which can recover
the full spectral information from randomly sampled data points. We confirm
experimentally the applicability of this technique by performing two
dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments on a two
spin system consisting of a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond
coupled to a single 13C nuclear spin. We show that the main peaks in the
spectrum can be obtained with only 10 % of the total number of the data points.
We believe that our results reported here can find an application in all types
of two dimensional spectroscopy, as long as the measured matrices have a low
rank.

argued that gauge theories with a soft breaking of BRST symmetry are
inconsistent.

The Mazur-Ulam property for commutative von Neumann algebras,"  Let $(\Omega,\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space. Given a Banach space
$X$, let the symbol $S(X)$ stand for the unit sphere of $X$. We prove that the

bounded functions equipped with the essential supremum norm, satisfies the
Mazur-Ulam property, that is, if $X$ is any complex Banach space, every
surjective isometry $\Delta: S(L^{\infty} (\Omega,\mu))\to S(X)$ admits an
extension to a surjective real linear isometry $T: L^{\infty} (\Omega,\mu)\to
X$. This conclusion is derived from a more general statement which assures that
every surjective isometry $\Delta : S(C(K))\to S(X),$ where $K$ is a Stonean
space, admits an extension to a surjective real linear isometry from $C(K)$
onto $X$.

"NLOS UV Channel Modeling Using Numerical Integration and an Approximate
  Closed-Form Path Loss Model","  In this paper we propose a simulation method using numerical integration, and
develop a closed-form link loss model for physical layer channel
characterization for non-line of sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) communication
systems. The impulse response of the channel is calculated by assuming both
uniform and Gaussian profiles for transmitted beams and different geometries.
The results are compared with previously published results. The accuracy of the
integration approach is compared to the Monte Carlo simulation. Then the path
loss using the simulation method and the suggested closed-form expression are
presented for different link geometries. The accuracies are evaluated and
compared to the results obtained using other methods.

Signatures of an Emergent Gravity from Black Hole Entropy,"  The existence of a thermodynamic description of horizons indicates that
spacetime has a microstructure. While the ""fundamental"" degrees of freedom
remain elusive, quantizing Einstein's gravity provides some clues about their
properties. A quantum AdS black hole possesses an equispaced mass spectrum,
independent of Newton's constant, $G$, when its horizon radius is large
compared to the AdS length. Moreover, the black hole's thermodynamics in this
limit is inextricably connected with its thermodynamics in the opposite
(Schwarzschild) limit by a duality of the Bose partition function. $G$, absent
in the mass spectrum, reemerges in the thermodynamic description through the
Schwarzschild limit, which should be viewed as a natural ""ground state"". It
seems that the Hawking-Page phase transition separates fundamental,
""particle-like"" degrees of freedom from effective, ""geometric"" ones.

The Asymptotic Capacity of the Optical Fiber,"  It is shown that signal energy is the only available degree-of-freedom (DOF)
for fiber-optic transmission as the input power tends to infinity. With $n$
signal DOFs at the input, $n-1$ DOFs are asymptotically lost to signal-noise
interactions. The main observation is that, nonlinearity introduces a
multiplicative noise in the channel, similar to fading in wireless channels.
The channel is viewed in the spherical coordinate system, where signal vector
$\underline{X}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ is represented in terms of its norm
$|\underline{X}|$ and direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$. The multiplicative noise
causes signal direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$ to vary randomly on the surface
of the unit $(2n-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, in such a way that the
effective area of the support of $\underline{\hat{X}}$ does not vanish as
$|\underline{X}|\rightarrow\infty$. On the other hand, the surface area of the
sphere is finite, so that $\underline{\hat{X}}$ carries finite information.
This observation is used to show several results. Firstly, let $\mathcal
C(\mathcal P)$ be the capacity of a discrete-time periodic model of the optical
fiber with distributed noise and frequency-dependent loss, as a function of the
average input power $\mathcal P$. It is shown that asymptotically as $\mathcal
P\rightarrow\infty$, $\mathcal C=\frac{1}{n}\log\bigl(\log\mathcal P\bigr)+c$,
where $n$ is the dimension of the input signal space and $c$ is a bounded
number. In particular, $\lim_{\mathcal P\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal C(\mathcal
P)=\infty$ in finite-dimensional periodic models. Secondly, it is shown that
capacity saturates to a constant in infinite-dimensional models where
$n=\infty$.

"Filament propagation length of femtosecond pulses with different
  transverse modes","  We experimentally studied intense femtosecond pulse filamentation and
propagation in water for Gaussian, Laguerre-Gaussian, and Bessel-Gaussian
incident beams. These different transverse modes for incident laser pulses were
created from an initial Gaussian beam by using a computer generated hologram
technique. We found that the length of the filament induced by the
Bessel-Gaussian incident beam was longer than that for the other transverse
modes under the conditions of the same peak intensity, pulse duration, and the
size of the central part of the beam. To better understand the Bessel-Gaussian
beam propagation, we performed a more detailed study of the filament length as
a function of the number of radial modal lobes. The length increased with the
number of lobes, implying that the radial modal lobes serve as an energy
reservoir for the filament formed by the central intensity peak.

"On the 'snow-plow' phase of supernovae interacting with dense
  circumstellar media","  Recently, Moriya et al. (2013) developed an analytic bolometric light curve
model for supernovae interacting with dense circumstellar media. Because of the
dense circumstellar medium, the shocked region is assumed to be radiative and
make a thin dense shell. The model is based on the conservation of momentum in
the shocked dense shell. However, the analytic model was mentioned to neglect
the 'snow-plow' phase of the shocked dense shell by Ofek et al. (2014). The
'snow-plow' or momentum-conserving phase refers to the period in which the
momentum injection from the supernova ejecta is almost terminated and the
radiative shocked dense shell keeps moving due only to the momentum previously
provided by the supernova ejecta. In this Note, I clarify that the analytic
model of Moriya et al. (2013) does take the 'snow-plow' phase into account and
the criticism of Ofek et al. (2014) is incorrect. In addition, Ofek et al.
(2014) related the sudden luminosity break observed in the light curve of Type
IIn SN 2010jl to the transition to the 'snow-plow' phase. However, I argue that
the sudden transition to the 'snow-plow' phase is not consistent with the
luminosity break observed in SN 2010jl. The luminosity break is likely to be
related to other phenomena like the dense shell exiting the dense part of the
circumstellar medium.

"Effective temperatures of a driven, strongly anisotropic Brownian system","  We use Brownian Dynamics computer simulations of a moderately dense colloidal
system undergoing steady shear flow to investigate the uniqueness of the
so-called effective temperature. We compare effective temperatures calculated
from the fluctuation-dissipation ratios and from the linear response to a
static, long wavelength, external perturbation along two directions: the shear
gradient direction and the vorticity direction. At high shear rates, when the
system is strongly anisotropic, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio derived
effective temperatures are approximately wave-vector independent, but the
temperatures along the gradient direction are somewhat higher than those along
the vorticity direction. The temperatures derived from the static linear
response show the same dependence on the direction as those derived from the
fluctuation-dissipation ratio. However, the former and the latter temperatures
are different. Our results suggest that the presently used formulae for
effective temperatures may not be applicable for strongly anisotropic, driven
systems.

"Decomposition of Unitary Matrices for Finding Quantum Circuits:
  Application to Molecular Hamiltonians","  Constructing appropriate unitary matrix operators for new quantum algorithms
and finding the minimum cost gate sequences for the implementation of these
unitary operators is of fundamental importance in the field of quantum
information and quantum computation. Evolution of quantum circuits faces two
major challenges: complex and huge search space and the high costs of
simulating quantum circuits on classical computers. Here, we use the group
leaders optimization algorithm to decompose a given unitary matrix into a
proper-minimum cost quantum gate sequence. We test the method on the known
decompositions of Toffoli gate, the amplification step of the Grover search
algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the sender part of the quantum
teleportation. Using this procedure, we present the circuit designs for the
simulation of the unitary propagators of the Hamiltonians for the hydrogen and
the water molecules. The approach is general and can be applied to generate the
sequence of quantum gates for larger molecular systems.

Four moments theorems on Markov chaos,"  We obtain quantitative Four Moments Theorems establishing convergence of the
laws of elements of a Markov chaos to a Pearson distribution, where the only
assumption we make on the Pearson distribution is that it admits four moments.
While in general one cannot use moments to establish convergence to a
heavy-tailed distributions, we provide a context in which only the first four
moments suffices. These results are obtained by proving a general carr\'e du
champ bound on the distance between laws of random variables in the domain of a
Markov diffusion generator and invariant measures of diffusions. For elements
of a Markov chaos, this bound can be reduced to just the first four moments.

The synthesis of Ti44 and Ni56 in massive stars,"  We discuss the influence of rotation on the combined synthesis of Ti44 and
Ni56 in massive stars. While Ni56 is significantly produced by both the
complete and incomplete explosive Si burning, Ti44 is mainly produced by the
complete explosive Si burning, with a minor contribution (in standard non
rotating models) from the incomplete explosive Si burning and the O burning
(both explosive and hydrostatic). We find that, in most cases, the thickness of
the region exposed to the incomplete explosive Si burning increases in rotating
models (v_ini=300 km/s) and since Ni56 is significantly produced in this zone,
the fraction of mass coming from the complete explosive Si burning zone,
necessary to get the required amount of Ni56, reduces. Therefore the amount of
Ti44 ejected for a given fixed amount of Ni56 decreases in rotating models.
However, some rotating models at [Fe/H]=-1 develop a very extended O convective
shell in which a consistent amount of Ti44 is formed, preserved and ejected in
the interstellar medium. Hence a better modeling of the thermal instabilities
(convection) in the advanced burning phases together with a critical analysis
of the cross sections of the nuclear reactions operating in O burning are
relevant for the understanding of the synthesis of Ti44.

only two parameters: the fundamental bandgap and the band velocity. In a
magnetic field, this model implies a unique property - spin splitting equal to
twice the cyclotron energy: Es = 2Ec. This explains the extensive
magneto-transport studies concluding a fortuitous degeneracy of the spin and
orbital split Landau levels in this material. The Es = 2Ec match differentiates
the massive Dirac electrons in bulk Bi2Se3 from those in quantum
electrodynamics, for which Es = Ec always holds.

BPP: Large Graph Storage for Efficient Disk Based Processing,"  Processing very large graphs like social networks, biological and chemical
compounds is a challenging task. Distributed graph processing systems process
the billion-scale graphs efficiently but incur overheads of efficient
partitioning and distribution of the graph over a cluster of nodes. Distributed
processing also requires cluster management and fault tolerance. In order to
overcome these problems GraphChi was proposed recently. GraphChi significantly
outperformed all the representative distributed processing frameworks. Still,
we observe that GraphChi incurs some serious degradation in performance due to
1) high number of non-sequential I/Os for processing every chunk of graph; and
2) lack of true parallelism to process the graph. In this paper we propose a
simple yet powerful engine BiShard Parallel Processor (BPP) to efficiently
process billions-scale graphs on a single PC. We extend the storage structure
proposed by GraphChi and introduce a new processing model called BiShard
Parallel (BP). BP enables full CPU parallelism for processing the graph and
significantly reduces the number of non-sequential I/Os required to process
every chunk of the graph. Our experiments on real large graphs show that our
solution significantly outperforms GraphChi.

"The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury XVII. Examining Obscured Star
  Formation with Synthetic Ultraviolet Flux Maps in M31","  We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet (FUV and NUV) maps of M31,
both with and without dust reddening. These maps were constructed from
spatially-resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble
Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling
to generate synthetic UV maps with projected spatial resolution of $\sim$100 pc
($\sim$24 arcseconds) The predicted UV flux agrees well with the observed flux,
with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of
$\log_{10}(f^{syn}/f^{obs}) = 0.03\pm0.24$ and $-0.03\pm0.16$ in the FUV and
NUV, respectively. This agreement is particularly impressive given that we used
only optical photometry to construct these UV maps. We use the dust-free maps
to examine properties of obscured flux and star formation by comparing our
reddened and dust-free FUV flux maps with the observed FUV and FUV+24{\mu}m
flux to examine the fraction of obscured flux. The synthetic flux maps require
that $\sim$90% of the FUV flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the
GALEX-based methods suggest that $\sim$70% of the flux is obscured. This
increase in the obscured flux estimate is driven by significant differences
between the dust-free synthetic FUV flux and that derived when correcting the
observed FUV for dust with 24{\mu}m observations. The difference is further
illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the FUV+24{\mu}m flux with
the 100 Myr average SFR from the SFHs. The 24{\mu}m-corrected FUV flux
underestimates the SFR by a factor of $\sim$2.3 - 2.5. [abridged]

"Probing the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the
  photoelectric heating within photodissociation regions","  We observationally investigate the relation between the photoelectric heating
efficiency in PDRs and the charge of PAHs, which are considered to play a key
role in photoelectric heating. Using PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six
PDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_0=100-10^5). To measure
the photoelectric heating efficiency, we obtained the intensities of the main
cooling lines, i.e., the [OI]63um, 145um, and [CII]158um, as well as the FIR
continuum intensity. We used Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to
investigate the MIR PAH features in the same regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH
emission into that of neutral (PAH^0) and positively ionized (PAH^+) species to
derive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the
photoelectric heating efficiency. The heating efficiency traced by
([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) / TIR, ranges between 0.1% and 0.9% in
different sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^0 + PAH^+) spans
from 0(+11)% to 87(+/-10)%. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low
heating efficiency, and all positions with a high heating efficiency have a low
PAH^+ fraction, supporting the scenario in which a positive grain charge
results in a decreased heating efficiency. Theoretical estimates of the
photoelectric heating efficiency show a stronger dependence on the charging
parameter gamma=G_0 T^{1/2}/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this
study, and the discrepancy is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric
heating efficiency on PAHs, traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) /
(PAH+[OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um), shows a much better match between the
observations and the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the
photoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs with a theoretical model indicates the
dominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating. (abridged for

"Hiding Sensitive Association Rules without Altering the Support of
  Sensitive Item(s)","  Association rule mining is an important data-mining technique that finds
interesting association among a large set of data items. Since it may disclose
patterns and various kinds of sensitive knowledge that are difficult to find
otherwise, it may pose a threat to the privacy of discovered confidential
information. Such information is to be protected against unauthorized access.
Many strategies had been proposed to hide the information. Some use distributed
databases over several sites, data perturbation, clustering, and data
distortion techniques. Hiding sensitive rules problem, and still not
sufficiently investigated, is the requirement to balance the confidentiality of
the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the user. The proposed approach
uses the data distortion technique where the position of the sensitive items is
altered but its support is never changed. The size of the database remains the
same. It uses the idea of representative rules to prune the rules first and
then hides the sensitive rules. Advantage of this approach is that it hides
maximum number of rules however, the existing approaches fail to hide all the
desired rules, which are supposed to be hidden in minimum number of passes. The
paper also compares of the proposed approach with existing ones.

Bose-Einstein condensation of a Knudsen gas,"  We reconcile a long-standing controversy regarding the transition temperature
of the Bose-Einstein condensation in a dilute interacting Bose gas, by showing
that there is a crossover between ideal gas and interacting gas. The former
corresponds to a Knudsen (or collisionless) regime, in which the mean-free-path
is much larger than the system dimension, while the latter corresponds to the
opposite hydrodynamic regime. The deviation of the transition temperature from
that of the non-interacting gas is proportional to the square root of a in the
Knudsen regime, and to a in the hydrodynamic regime, where a is the scattering
length. This crossover may be observable in a Bose gas trapped in a potential
or on an optical lattice.

"Constraining a matter-dominated cosmological model with bulk viscosity
  proportional to the Hubble parameter","  We present and constrain a cosmological model where the only component is a
pressureless fluid with bulk viscosity as an explanation for the present
accelerated expansion of the universe. We study the particular model of a bulk
viscosity coefficient proportional to the Hubble parameter. The model is
constrained using the SNe Ia Gold 2006 sample, the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) shift parameter R, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peak A and the
Second Law of Thermodynamics (SLT). It was found that this model is in
agreement with the SLT using only the SNe Ia test. However when the model is
constrained using the three cosmological tests together (SNe+CMB+BAO) we found:
1.- The model violates the SLT, 2.- It predicts a value of H_0 \approx 53 km
sec^{-1} Mpc^{-1} for the Hubble constant, and 3.- We obtain a bad fit to data
with a \chi^2_{min} \approx 532. These results indicate that this model is
viable just if the bulk viscosity is triggered in recent times.

"Direct imaging of thermally excited metastable structures of ion Coulomb
  clusters","  Coulomb crystallisation of large ensembles of ions has in the past years been
intensively studied experimentally with many spectacular results of relevance
to infinite systems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions.While strings of a few
ions have proven to be very attractive objects in quantum information
processing, larger Coulomb crystals have very recently found applications
within other aspects the dynamics of quantum systems. Smaller finite ensembles
of cold identical charged particles confined by a harmonic potential
furthermore constitute very special types of clusters due to the pure repulsive
long-range inter-particle forces. Here, we report on the direct imaging of
metastable structures of Coulomb clusters consisting of a few thousands
confined and laser-cooled 40Ca+ ions. The observations are attributed to
structural excitations due to finite temperatures, a feature likely to appear
in clusters of short-range interacting particles, but yet not observed
directly.

"Hybrid magic state distillation for universal fault-tolerant quantum
  computation","  A set of stabilizer operations augmented by some special initial states known
as 'magic states', gives the possibility of universal fault-tolerant quantum
computation. However, magic state preparation inevitably involves nonideal
operations that introduce noise. The most common method to eliminate the noise
is magic state distillation (MSD) by stabilizer operations. Here we propose a
hybrid MSD protocol by connecting a four-qubit H-type MSD with a five-qubit
T-type MSD, in order to overcome some disadvantages of the previous MSD
protocols. The hybrid MSD protocol further integrates distillable ranges of
different existing MSD protocols and extends the T-type distillable range to
the stabilizer octahedron edges. And it provides considerable improvement in
qubit cost for almost all of the distillable range. Moreover, we experimentally
demonstrate the four-qubit H-type MSD protocol using nuclear magnetic resonance
technology, together with the previous five-qubit MSD experiment, to show the
feasibility of the hybrid MSD protocol.

"On the Stability and Accuracy of Partially and Fully Implicit Schemes
  for Phase Field Modeling","  We study in this paper the accuracy and stability of partially and fully
implicit schemes for phase field modeling. Through theoretical and numerical
analysis of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hillard models, we investigate the potential
problems of using partially implicit schemes, demonstrate the importance of
using fully implicit schemes and discuss the limitation of energy stability
that are often used to evaluate the quality of a numerical scheme for
phase-field modeling. In particular, we make the following observations: 1. a
convex splitting scheme (CSS in short) can be equivalent to some fully implicit
scheme (FIS in short) with a much different time scaling and thus it may lack
numerical accuracy; 2. most implicit schemes (in discussions) are energy-stable
if the time-step size is sufficiently small; 3. a traditionally known
conditionally energy-stable scheme still possess an unconditionally
energy-stable physical solution; 4. an unconditionally energy-stable scheme is
not necessarily better than a conditionally energy-stable scheme when the time
step size is not small enough; 5. a first-order FIS for the Allen-Cahn model
can be devised so that the maximum principle will be valid on the discrete
level and hence the discrete phase variable satisfies $|u_h(x)|\le 1$ for all
$x$ and, furthermore, the linearized discretized system can be effectively
preconditioned by discrete Poisson operators.

Ellipsoidal cones in normed vector spaces,"  We give two characterizations of cones over ellipsoids in real normed vector
spaces. Let $C$ be a closed convex cone with nonempty interior such that $C$
has a bounded section of codimension $1$. We show that $C$ is a cone over an

We also show that $C$ is a cone over an ellipsoid if and only if the affine
span of $\partial C \cap \partial(a - C)$ has codimension $1$ for every point
$a$ in the interior of $C$. These results generalize the finite-dimensional
cases proved in (Jer\'onimo-Castro and McAllister, 2013).

Mechanics of disordered auxetic metamaterials,"  Auxetic materials are of great engineering interest not only because of their
fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to their increased toughness
and indentation resistance. These materials are typically synthesized polyester
foams with a very heterogeneous structure, but the role of disorder in auxetic
behavior is not fully understood. Here, we provide a systematic theoretical and
experimental investigation in to the effect of disorder on the mechanical
properties of a paradigmatic auxetic lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal
geometry. We show that disorder has a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio
unless the lattice topology is altered, and in all cases examined the disorder
preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of loading
applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or ductile failure
is observed. It is found that brittle failure is associated with a
disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in ductile failure disorder does
not affect strength. Our work thus provides general guidelines to optimize
elasticity and strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.

"Vortices in quantum droplets: Analogies between boson and fermion
  systems","  The main theme of this review is the many-body physics of vortices in quantum
droplets of bosons or fermions, in the limit of small particle numbers. Systems
of interest include cold atoms in traps as well as electrons confined in
quantum dots. When set to rotate, these in principle very different quantum
systems show remarkable analogies. The topics reviewed include the structure of
the finite rotating many-body state, universality of vortex formation and
localization of vortices in both bosonic and fermionic systems, and the
emergence of particle-vortex composites in the quantum Hall regime. An overview
of the computational many-body techniques sets focus on the configuration
interaction and density-functional methods. Studies of quantum droplets with
one or several particle components, where vortices as well as coreless vortices
may occur, are reviewed, and theoretical as well as experimental challenges are
discussed.

"Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Object Detection with
  Expectation-Maximization Algorithm","  Object detection when provided image-level labels instead of instance-level
labels (i.e., bounding boxes) during training is an important problem in
computer vision, since large scale image datasets with instance-level labels
are extremely costly to obtain. In this paper, we address this challenging
problem by developing an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based object detection
method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method is
applicable to both the weakly-supervised and semi-supervised settings.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark show that (1) in the weakly
supervised setting, our method provides significant detection performance
improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, (2) having access to a small
number of strongly (instance-level) annotated images, our method can almost
match the performace of the fully supervised Fast RCNN. We share our source
code at https://github.com/ZiangYan/EM-WSD.

Applications of the Likelihood Theory in Finance: Modelling and Pricing,"  This paper discusses the connection between mathematical finance and
statistical modelling which turns out to be more than a formal mathematical
correspondence. We like to figure out how common results and notions in
statistics and their meaning can be translated to the world of mathematical
finance and vice versa. A lot of similarities can be expressed in terms of
LeCam's theory for statistical experiments which is the theory of the behaviour
of likelihood processes. For positive prices the arbitrage free financial
assets fit into filtered experiments. It is shown that they are given by
filtered likelihood ratio processes. From the statistical point of view,
martingale measures, completeness and pricing formulas are revisited. The
pricing formulas for various options are connected with the power functions of
tests. For instance the Black-Scholes price of a European option has an
interpretation as Bayes risk of a Neyman Pearson test. Under contiguity the
convergence of financial experiments and option prices are obtained. In
particular, the approximation of Ito type price processes by discrete models
and the convergence of associated option prices is studied. The result relies
on the central limit theorem for statistical experiments, which is well known
in statistics in connection with local asymptotic normal (LAN) families. As

Cost-Sensitive Label Embedding for Multi-Label Classification,"  Label embedding (LE) is an important family of multi-label classification
algorithms that digest the label information jointly for better performance.
Different real-world applications evaluate performance by different cost
functions of interest. Current LE algorithms often aim to optimize one specific
cost function, but they can suffer from bad performance with respect to other
cost functions. In this paper, we resolve the performance issue by proposing a
novel cost-sensitive LE algorithm that takes the cost function of interest into
account. The proposed algorithm, cost-sensitive label embedding with
multidimensional scaling (CLEMS), approximates the cost information with the
distances of the embedded vectors by using the classic multidimensional scaling
approach for manifold learning. CLEMS is able to deal with both symmetric and
asymmetric cost functions, and effectively makes cost-sensitive decisions by
nearest-neighbor decoding within the embedded vectors. We derive theoretical
results that justify how CLEMS achieves the desired cost-sensitivity.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that CLEMS is
significantly better than a wide spectrum of existing LE algorithms and
state-of-the-art cost-sensitive algorithms across different cost functions.

"Rips filtrations for quasi-metric spaces and asymmetric functions with
  stability results","  The Rips filtration over a finite metric space and its corresponding
persistent homology are prominent methods in TDA to summarise the shape of
data. Crucial to their use is the bottleneck stability result. A generalisation
of the Rips filtration to any symmetric function $f:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$
was defined by Chazal, De Silva and Oudot, and they showed it was stable with
respect to the correspondence distortion distance. Allowing asymmetry, we
consider four different persistence modules. The first method is through
symmetrisation. For $a\in [0,1]$ we can construct a symmetric function
$sym_a(f)(x,y)=a \min \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}+ (1-a)\max \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}$. We can
then follow the apply the standard theory for symmetric functions and get
stability as a corollary. The second method is to construct a filtration of
ordered tuple complexes where tuple $(x_0, x_2, \ldots x_p)\in Rips^{dir}(X)_t$
if $d(x_i, x_j)\leq t$ for all $i\leq j$. These two methods have the same
persistent homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric
space, or more generally to a symmetric function. We consider two constructions
using a filtration of directed graphs. We have directed graphs $\{D(X)_t\}$,
where directed edges $x\to y$ are included in $D(X)_t$ whenever
$\max\{f(x,y),f(x,x),f(y,y)\}\leq t$. From this we construct a preorder where
$x\leq y$ if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D(X)_t$. We build persistence
modules using the strongly connected components of the graphs $D(X)_t$, which
are the equivalence classes of the associated preorders. We consider
persistence modules using a generalisation of poset topology to preorders. The
Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be extended as a correspondence distortion
distance to set-function pairs. We prove that all these new constructions enjoy
the same stability results.

A momentum-space Argonne V18 interaction,"  This paper gives a momentum-space representation of the Argonne V18 potential
as an expansion in products of spin-isospin operators with scalar coefficient
functions of the momentum transfer. Two representations of the scalar
coefficient functions for the strong part of the interaction are given. One is
as an expansion in an orthonormal basis of rational functions and the other as
an expansion in Chebyshev polynomials on different intervals. Both provide
practical and efficient representations for computing the momentum-space
potential that do not require integration or interpolation. Programs based on
both expansions are available as supplementary material. Analytic expressions
are given for the scalar coefficient functions of the Fourier transform of the
electromagnetic part of the Argonne V18. A simple method for computing the
partial-wave projections of these interactions from the operator expressions is
also given.

21cm fluctuations from primordial magnetic fields,"  Recent observations of magnetic fields in intergalactic void regions and in
high redshift galaxies may indicate that large scale magnetic fields have a
primordial origin. If primordial magnetic fields were present soon after the
recombination epoch, they would have induced density fluctuations on the one
hand and dissipated their energy into the primordial gas on the other, and
thereby significantly alter the thermal history of the Universe. Here we
consider both the effects and calculate the brightness temperature fluctuations
of the 21cm line using simple Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the
fluctuations of the 21cm line from the energy dissipation appear only on very
small scales and those from the density fluctuations always dominate on
observationally relevant angular scales.

"An Extensive, Sensitive Search for SiO Masers in High- and
  Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Regions","  We present sensitive Very Large Array observations with an angular resolution
of a few arcseconds of the $J= 1 - 0$ line of SiO in the $v$=1 and 2
vibrationally excited states toward a sample of 60 Galactic regions in which
stars of high or intermediate mass are currently forming and/or have recently
formed. We report the detection of SiO maser emission in \textit{both}
vibrationally excited transitions toward only three very luminous regions:
Orion-KL, W51N and Sgr B2(M). Toward all three, SiO maser emission had
previously been reported, in Orion-KL in both lines, in W51N only in the $v=2$
line and in Sgr B2(M) only in the $v=1$ line. Our work confirms that SiO maser
emission in star-forming regions is a rare phenomenon, indeed, that requires
special, probably extreme, physical and chemical conditions not commonly found.
In addition to this SiO maser survey, we also present images of the
simultaneously observed 7 mm continuum emission from a subset of our sample of
star-forming regions where such emission was detected. This is in most cases
likely to be free-free emission from compact- and ultracompact-HII regions.

The Outer Envelopes of Globular Clusters. I. NGC 7089 (M2),"  We present the results of a wide-field imaging survey of the periphery of the
Milky Way globular cluster NGC 7089 (M2). Data were obtained with MegaCam on
the Magellan Clay Telescope, and the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco
Telescope. We find that M2 is embedded in a diffuse stellar envelope extending
to a radial distance of at least $\sim 60^{\prime}$ ($\sim 210$ pc) -- five
times the nominal tidal radius of the cluster. The envelope appears nearly
circular in shape, has a radial density decline well described by a power law
of index $\gamma = -2.2 \pm 0.2$, and contains approximately $1.6\%$ of the
luminosity of the entire system. While the origin of the envelope cannot be
robustly identified using the presently available data, the fact that M2 also
hosts stellar populations exhibiting a broad dispersion in the abundances of
both iron and a variety of neutron capture elements suggests that this object
might plausibly constitute the stripped nucleus of a dwarf Galaxy that was long
ago accreted and destroyed by the Milky Way.

Vesper: Using Echo-Analysis to Detect Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in LANs,"  The Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a cyber-attack in which an attacker
intercepts traffic, thus harming the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the network. It remains a popular attack vector due to its
simplicity. However, existing solutions are either not portable, suffer from a
high false positive rate, or are simply not generic. In this paper, we propose
Vesper: a novel plug-and-play MitM detector for local area networks. Vesper
uses a technique inspired from impulse response analysis used in the domain of
acoustic signal processing. Analogous to how echoes in a cave capture the shape
and construction of the environment, so to can a short and intense pulse of
ICMP echo requests model the link between two network hosts. Vesper uses neural
networks called autoencoders to model the normal patterns of the echoed pulses,
and detect when the environment changes. Using this technique, Vesper is able
to detect MitM attacks with high accuracy while incurring minimal network
overhead. We evaluate Vesper on LANs consisting of video surveillance cameras,
servers, and PC workstations. We also investigate several possible adversarial
attacks against Vesper, and demonstrate how Vesper mitigates these attacks.

"Comparative Analysis of Brookhaven National Laboratory Nuclear Decay
  Data and Super-Kamiokande Neutrino Data: Indication of a Solar Connection","  An experiment carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory from February
1982 to December 1989 acquired 364 measurements of the beta-decay rates of a
sample of 36Cl and of a sample of 32Si. The experimenters reported finding
small periodic annual deviations of the data points from an exponential decay -
of uncertain origin. We here analyze this dataset by power spectrum analysis
and by forming spectrograms and phasegrams. We confirm the occurrence of annual
oscillations but we also find evidence of oscillations in a band of frequencies
appropriate for the internal rotation of the Sun. Both datasets show clear
evidence of a transient oscillation with a frequency of 12.7 cycles per year
that falls in the range of rotational frequencies for the solar radiative zone.
We repeat these analyses for 358 neutrino measurements acquired by
Super-Kamiokande over the interval May 1986 to August 2001. Spectrogram
analysis yields a strong and steady oscillation at about 9.5 cycles per year
and an intermittent oscillation with frequency in the range 12.5 - 12.7 cycles
per year. We attribute the former to rotation of the solar core and the latter
to rotation in the radiative zone. Since the flux of neutrinos (8B neutrinos)
responsible for the Super-Kamiokande measurements is known, we are able to
estimate the cross sections for the beta-decay oscillations at 12.7 cycles per
year. These estimates are found to be 10-21.6 cm-2 for 36Cl and 10-18.4 cm-2
for 32Si. We suggest that the beta-decay process is influenced by neutrinos,
and that the solar neutrino flux is modulated by magnetic field in the deep
solar interior by Resonant Spin Flavor Precession.

"Origins of bond and spin order in rare-earth nickelate bulk and
  heterostructures","  We analyze the charge- and spin response functions of rare-earth nickelates
RNiO3 and their heterostructures using random-phase approximation in a two-band
Hubbard model. The inter-orbital charge fluctuation is found to be the driving
mechanism for the rock-salt type bond order in bulk RNiO3, and good agreement
of the ordering temperature with experimental values is achieved for all RNiO3
using realistic crystal structures and interaction parameters. We further show
that magnetic ordering in bulk is not driven by the spin fluctuation and should
be instead explained as ordering of localized moments. This picture changes for
low-dimensional heterostructures, where the charge fluctuation is suppressed
and overtaken by the enhanced spin instability, which results in a
spin-density-wave ground state observed in recent experiments. Predictions for
spectroscopy allow for further experimental testing of our claims.

"Isotopic liftings of Clifford algebras and applications in elementary
  particle mass matrices","  Isotopic liftings of algebraic structures are investigated in the context of
Clifford algebras, where it is defined a new product involving an arbitrary,
but fixed, element of the Clifford algebra. This element acts as the unit with
respect to the introduced product, and is called isounit. We construct
isotopies in both associative and non-associative arbitrary algebras, and
examples of these constructions are exhibited using Clifford algebras, which
although associative, can generate the octonionic, non-associative, algebra.
The whole formalism is developed in a Clifford algebraic arena, giving also the
necessary pre-requisites to introduce isotopies of the exterior algebra. The
flavor hadronic symmetry of the six u,d,s,c,b,t quarks is shown to be exact,
when the generators of the isotopic Lie algebra su(6) are constructed, and the
unit of the isotopic Clifford algebra is shown to be a function of the six
quark masses. The limits constraining the parameters, that are entries of the
representation of the isounit in the isotopic group SU(6), are based on the
most recent limits imposed on quark masses.

"Giant isochoric compressibility of solid Helium-4: the bistability of
  superlcimbing dislocations","  A significant accumulation of matter in solid Helium-4 observed during the
superflow events, dubbed as the giant isochoric compressibility (or the syringe
effect), is discussed within the model of dislocations with superfluid core. It
is shown that solid Helium-4 in a contact with superfluid reservoir can develop
a bistability with respect to the syringe fraction, with the threshold for the
bias by chemical potential determined by a typical free length of dislocations
with superfluid core. The main implications of this effect are: hysteresis and
strongly non-linear dynamical behavior leading to growth, proliferation and
possibly exiting from a crystal of superclimbing dislocations. Three major
channels for such dynamics are identified: i) injection and inflation of the
prismatic loops from the boundary; ii) Bardeed-Herring generation of the loops
in the bulk; iii) helical instability of the screw dislocations. It is argued
that the current experiments are likely to be well in this regime. Several
testable predictions for the time and the bias dependencies of the dynamics are
suggested

Geometric inequalities for axially symmetric black holes,"  A geometric inequality in General Relativity relates quantities that have
both a physical interpretation and a geometrical definition. It is well known
that the parameters that characterize the Kerr-Newman black hole satisfy
several important geometric inequalities. Remarkably enough, some of these
inequalities also hold for dynamical black holes. This kind of inequalities
play an important role in the characterization of the gravitational collapse,
they are closed related with the cosmic censorship conjecture. Axially
symmetric black holes are the natural candidates to study these inequalities
because the quasi-local angular momentum is well defined for them. We review
recent results in this subject and we also describe the main ideas behind the
proofs. Finally, a list of relevant open problem is presented.

A hierarchical loss and its problems when classifying non-hierarchically,"  Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse
and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle;
after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing
metrics of failure (so-called ""loss"" or ""win"") used in textual or visual
classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori
information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a
skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed
possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any
given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a
classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called
ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from
the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the
standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent
with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as
much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize
the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as
an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to
minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful
metric of success of a classifier.

"Dark matter inner slope and concentration in galaxies: from the Fornax
  dwarf to M87","  We apply two new state-of-the-art methods that model the distribution of
observed tracers in projected phase space to lift the mass / velocity
anisotropy (VA) degeneracy and deduce constraints on the mass profiles of
galaxies, as well as their VA. We first show how a distribution function based
method applied to the satellite kinematics of otherwise isolated SDSS galaxies
shows convincing observational evidence of age matching: red galaxies have more
concentrated dark matter (DM) halos than blue galaxies of the same stellar or
halo mass. Then, applying the MAMPOSSt technique to M87 (traced by its red and
blue globular clusters) we find that very cuspy DM is favored, unless we
release priors on DM concentration or stellar mass (leading to unconstrained
slope). For the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (traced by its metal-rich and
metal-poor stars), the inner DM slope is unconstrained, with weak evidence for
a core if the stellar mass is fixed. This highlights how priors are crucial for

$R^2$ corrections to holographic Schwinger effect,"  We study $R^2$ corrections to the holographic Schwinger effect in an AdS
black hole background and a confining D3-brane background, respectively. The
potential analysis for these backgrounds is presented. The critical values for
the electric field are obtained. It is shown that for both backgrounds
increasing the Gauss-Bonnet parameter the Schwinger effect is enhanced.
Moreover, the results provide an estimate of how the Schwinger effect changes
with the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, at strong
coupling.

The Neutron Electric Dipole Moment and Probe of PeV Scale Physics,"  The experimental limit on the neutron electric dipole moment is used as a
possible probe of new physics beyond the standard model. Within MSSM we use the
current experimental limit on the neutron EDM and possible future improvement
as a probe of high scale SUSY. Quantitative analyses show that scalar masses as
large as a PeV and larger could be probed in improved experiment far above the
scales accessible at future colliders. We also discuss the neutron EDM as a
probe of new physics models beyond MSSM. Specifically we consider an MSSM
extension with a particle content including a vectorlike multiplet. Such an
extension brings in new sources of CP violation beyond those in MSSM. These CP
phases contribute to the EDM of the quarks and to the neutron EDM. These
contributions are analyzed in this work where we include the supersymmetric
loop diagrams involving the neutralinos, charginos, the gluino, squark and
mirror squark exchange diagrams at the one loop level. We also take into
account the contributions from the $W$, $Z$, quark and mirror quark exchanges
arising from the mixings of the vectorlike generation with the three
generations. It is shown that the experimental limit on the neutron EDM can be
used to probe such new physics models. In the future one expects the neutron
EDM to improve an order of magnitude or more allowing one to extend the probe
of high scale SUSY and of new physics models. For the MSSM the probe of high
scales could go up to and beyond PeV scale masses.

The Taurid complex meteor showers and asteroids,"  The structure of the Taurid meteor complex based on photographic orbits
available in the IAU Meteor database is studied. We have searched for potential
sub-streams or filaments to be associated with the complex utilizing the
Southworth-Hawkins D-criterion. Applying a strict limiting value for D=0.10,
fifteen sub-streams or filaments, consisting of more than three members, could
be separated out from the general complex. To confirm their mutual consistence
as filaments, rather than fortuitous clumping at the present time, the orbital
evolution over 5000 years of each member is studied. Utilizing the D-criterion
we also searched for NEOs that might be associated with the streams and
filaments of the complex and investigated the orbital evolution of potential
members. Possible associations between 7 Taurid filaments and 9 NEOs were
found. The most probable are for S Psc(b) -- 2003QC10, N Tau(a) -- 2004TG10, o
Ori -- 2003UL3 and N Tau(b) -- 2002XM35. Some of the potential parent objects
could be either dormant comets or larger boulders moving within the complex.
Three of the most populated filaments of the complex may have originated from
2P/Encke.

"Energy conservation and numerical stability for the reduced MHD models
  of the non-linear JOREK code","  In this paper we present a rigorous derivation of the reduced MHD models with
and without parallel velocity that are implemented in the non-linear MHD code
JOREK. The model we obtain contains some terms that have been neglected in the
implementation but might be relevant in the non-linear phase. These are
necessary to guarantee exact conservation with respect to the full MHD energy.
For the second part of this work, we have replaced the linearized time stepping
of JOREK by a non-linear solver based on the Inexact Newton method including
adaptive time stepping. We demonstrate that this approach is more robust
especially with respect to numerical errors in the saturation phase of an
instability and allows to use larger time steps in the non-linear phase.

"Effect of Coulomb correlation on electron transport through concentric
  quantum ring-quantum dot structure","  We theoretically study the single electron transfer through two-terminal
quantum ring capacitively coupled to charged dot placed in its center. For this
purpose we solve time-dependent Schrodinger equation for fully correlated
two-particle system constituted by the transferred electron and the second
particle confined in the dot. Analysis of transmission probability dependence
on magnetic field in Ahronov-Bohm effect indicates that the maxima of
transmission probability may be enhanced as well as reduced for attractive or
repulsive Coulomb interaction respectively. The existence of Coulomb
correlation in the system may also lead to inelastic scattering of the
transferred electron. In such case, transmission of electron thorugh the ring
is not completely blocked for (n+1/2) magnetic flux quanta.

"Blocking Transferability of Adversarial Examples in Black-Box Learning
  Systems","  Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral
component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and
driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services
offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service
tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the
classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that
adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another
classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different
architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is
known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box
systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and
transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to
protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block
their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the
input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on
the original label and instead predicts that the input is ""invalid"". In
essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the
classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In
experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on
the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed
method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining
the accuracy on clean data.

Transits of extrasolar moons around luminous giant planets,"  Beyond Earth-like planets, moons can be habitable, too. No exomoons have been
securely detected, but they could be extremely abundant. Young Jovian planets
can be as hot as late M stars, with effective temperatures of up to 2000 K.
Transits of their moons might be detectable in their infrared photometric light
curves if the planets are sufficiently separated ($\gtrsim10$ AU) from the
stars to be directly imaged. The moons will be heated by radiation from their
young planets and potentially by tidal friction. Although stellar illumination
will be weak beyond 5 AU, these alternative energy sources could liquify
surface water on exomoons for hundreds of Myr. A Mars-mass H$_2$O-rich moon
around $\beta$ Pic b would have a transit depth of $1.5\times10^{-3}$, in reach
of near-future technology.

6s$_{1/2}$ ground state of $^{133}$Cs to $n$p$_{1/2}$ and $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg
states. The transition frequencies are determined by one-photon UV spectroscopy
in ultracold samples of Cs atoms using a narrowband laser system referenced to
a frequency comb. From a global fit of the ionization energy $E_\mathrm{I}$ and
the quantum defects of the two series we determine an improved value of
$E_\mathrm{I} = h c \cdot 31 406.467 732 5(14)$ cm$^{-1}$ for the ionization
energy of Cs with a relative uncertainty of $5\times10^{-11}$. We also report
improved values for the quantum defects of the $n$p$_{1/2}$, $n$p$_{3/2}$,
$n$s$_{1/2}$, and $n$d$_{5/2}$ series.

"Shift operators, residue families and degenerate Laplacians","  We introduce new aspects in conformal geometry of some very natural
second-order differential operators. These operators are termed shift
operators. In the flat space, they are intertwining operators which are closely
related to symmetry breaking differential operators. In the curved case, they
are closely connected with ideas of holography and the works of
Fefferman-Graham, Gover-Waldron and one of the authors. In particular, we
obtain an alternative description of the so-called residue families in
conformal geometry in terms of compositions of shift operators. This relation
allows easy new proofs of some of their basic properties. In addition, we
derive new holographic formulas for $Q$-curvatures in even dimension. Since
these turn out to be equivalent to earlier holographic formulas, the novelty
here is their conceptually very natural proof. The overall discussion leads to
a unification of constructions in representation theory and conformal geometry.

Stability of localized modes in PT-symmetric nonlinear potentials,"  We report on detailed investigation of the stability of localized modes in
the nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a nonlinear parity-time (alias PT)
symmetric potential. We are particularly focusing on the case where the
spatially-dependent nonlinearity is purely imaginary. We compute the Evans
function of the linear operator determining the linear stability of localized
modes. Results of the Evans function analysis predict that for sufficiently
small dissipation localized modes become stable when the propagation constant
exceeds certain threshold value. This is the case for periodic and
$\tanh$-shaped complex potentials where the modes having widths comparable with
or smaller than the characteristic width of the complex potential are stable,
while broad modes are unstable. In contrast, in complex potentials that change
linearly with transverse coordinate all modes are stable, what suggests that
the relation between width of the modes and spatial size of the complex
potential define the stability in the general case. These results were
confirmed using the direct propagation of the solutions for the mentioned
examples.

Deterministic aspects of nonlinear modulation instability,"  Different from statistical considerations on stochastic wave fields, this
paper aims to contribute to the understanding of (some of) the underlying
physical phenomena that may give rise to the occurrence of extreme, rogue,
waves. To that end a specific deterministic wavefield is investigated that
develops extreme waves from a uniform background. For this explicitly described
nonlinear extension of the Benjamin-Feir instability, the soliton on finite
background of the NLS equation, the global down-stream evolving distortions,
the time signal of the extreme waves, and the local evolution near the extreme
position are investigated. As part of the search for conditions to obtain
extreme waves, we show that the extreme wave has a specific optimization
property for the physical energy, and comment on the possible validity for more
realistic situations.

Quantized Memory-Augmented Neural Networks,"  Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) refer to a class of neural network
models equipped with external memory (such as neural Turing machines and memory
networks). These neural networks outperform conventional recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) in terms of learning long-term dependency, allowing them to
solve intriguing AI tasks that would otherwise be hard to address. This paper
concerns the problem of quantizing MANNs. Quantization is known to be effective
when we deploy deep models on embedded systems with limited resources.
Furthermore, quantization can substantially reduce the energy consumption of
the inference procedure. These benefits justify recent developments of
quantized multi layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and RNNs. However,
no prior work has reported the successful quantization of MANNs. The in-depth
analysis presented here reveals various challenges that do not appear in the
quantization of the other networks. Without addressing them properly, quantized
MANNs would normally suffer from excessive quantization error which leads to
degraded performance. In this paper, we identify memory addressing
(specifically, content-based addressing) as the main reason for the performance
degradation and propose a robust quantization method for MANNs to address the
challenge. In our experiments, we achieved a computation-energy gain of 22x
with 8-bit fixed-point and binary quantization compared to the floating-point
implementation. Measured on the bAbI dataset, the resulting model, named the
quantized MANN (Q-MANN), improved the error rate by 46% and 30% with 8-bit
fixed-point and binary quantization, respectively, compared to the MANN
quantized using conventional techniques.

Vortical field amplification and particle acceleration at rippled shocks,"  Supernova Remnants (SNRs) shocks are believed to accelerate charged particles
and to generate strong turbulence in the post-shock flow. From high-energy
observations in the past decade, a magnetic field at SNR shocks largely
exceeding the shock-compressed interstellar field has been inferred. We outline
how such a field amplification results from a small-scale dynamo process
downstream of the shock, providing an explicit expression for the turbulence
back-reaction to the fluid whirling. The spatial scale of the $X-$ray rims and
the short time-variability can be obtained by using reasonable parameters for
the interstellar turbulence. We show that such a vortical field saturation is
faster than the acceleration time of the synchrotron emitting energetic
electrons.

"Investigation of the Galactic Magnetic Field with Ultra-High Energy
  Cosmic Rays","  We present a method to correct for deflections of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays in the galactic magnetic field. We perform these corrections by simulating
the expected arrival directions of protons using a parameterization of the
field derived from Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission measurements. To
evaluate the method we introduce a simulated astrophysical scenario and two
observables designed for testing cosmic ray deflections. We show that protons
can be identified by taking advantage of the galactic magnetic field pattern.
Consequently, cosmic ray deflection in the galactic field can be verified
experimentally. The method also enables searches for directional correlations
of cosmic rays with source candidates.

"Fractality of wave functions on a Cayley tree: Difference between a tree

terms of the decay rate and the velocity in a problem of propagation of a front
between unstable and stable phases. We demonstrate a crucial difference between

"Single electrons from heavy-flavor mesons in relativistic heavy-ion
  collisions","  We study the single electron spectra from $D-$ and $B-$meson semileptonic
decays in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$200, 62.4, and 19.2 GeV by
employing the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that has
been shown to reasonably describe the charm dynamics at RHIC and LHC energies
on a microscopic level. In this approach the initial heavy quarks are produced
by using the PYTHIA which is tuned to reproduce the FONLL calculations. The
produced heavy quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in QGP with
scattering cross sections which are calculated in the dynamical quasi-particle
model (DQPM). At energy densities close to the critical energy density the
heavy quarks are hadronized into heavy mesons through either coalescence or
fragmentation. After hadronization the heavy mesons interact with the light
hadrons by employing the scattering cross sections from an effective
Lagrangian. The final heavy mesons then produce single electrons through
semileptonic decay. We find that the PHSD approach well describes the nuclear
modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ of single electrons in
d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 200 GeV and the elliptic flow
in Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV from the PHENIX
collaboration, however, the large $R_{\rm AA}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV
is not described at all. Furthermore, we make predictions for the $R_{\rm AA}$
of $D-$mesons and of single electrons at the lower energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}=$ 19.2 GeV. Additionally, the medium modification of the azimuthal angle
$\phi$ between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark is studied. We find that the
transverse flow enhances the azimuthal angular distributions close to $\phi=$ 0
because the heavy flavors strongly interact with nuclear medium in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions and almost flow with the bulk matter.

Naming Game on Networks: Let Everyone be Both Speaker and Hearer,"  To investigate how consensus is reached on a large self-organized
peer-to-peer network, we extended the naming game model commonly used in
language and communication to Naming Game in Groups (NGG). Differing from other
existing naming game models, in NGG, everyone in the population (network) can
be both speaker and hearer simultaneously, which resembles in a closer manner
to real-life scenarios. Moreover, NGG allows the transmission (communication)
of multiple words (opinions) for multiple intra-group consensuses. The
communications among indirectly-connected nodes are also enabled in NGG. We
simulated and analyzed the consensus process in some typical network
topologies, including random-graph networks, small-world networks and
scale-free networks, to better understand how global convergence (consensus)
could be reached on one common word. The results are interpreted on group
negotiation of a peer-to-peer network, which shows that global consensus in the
population can be reached more rapidly when more opinions are permitted within
each group or when the negotiating groups in the population are larger in size.
The novel features and properties introduced by our model have demonstrated its
applicability in better investigating general consensus problems on
peer-to-peer networks.

A numerical invariant for linear representations of finite groups,"  We study the notion of essential dimension for a linear representation of a
finite group. In characteristic zero we relate it to the canonical dimension of
certain products of Weil transfers of generalized Severi-Brauer varieties. We
then proceed to compute the canonical dimension of a broad class of varieties
of this type, extending earlier results of the first author. As a consequence,
we prove analogues of classical theorems of R. Brauer and O. Schilling about
the Schur index, where the Schur index of a representation is replaced by its
essential dimension. In the last section we show that essential dimension of
representations can behave in rather unexpected ways in the modular setting.

"Origin of the literature discrepancies in the fractional reduction of
  the apex-field enhancement factor considering small clusters of field
  emitters","  Numerical simulations are important when assessing the many characteristics
of field emission related phenomena. In small simulation domains, the
electrostatic effect from the boundaries is known to influence the calculated
apex field enhancement factor (FEF) of the emitter, but no established
dependence has been reported at present. In this work, we report the dependence
of the lateral size, $L$, and the height, $H$, of the simulation domain on the
apex-FEF of a single conducting ellipsoidal emitter. Firstly, we analyze the
error, $\varepsilon$, in the calculation of the apex-FEF as a function of $H$
and $L$. Importantly, our results show that the effects of $H$ and $L$ on
$\varepsilon$ are scale invariant, allowing one to predict $\varepsilon$ for
ratios $L/h$ and $H/h$, where $h$ is the height of the emitter. Next, we
analyze the fractional change of the apex-FEF, $\delta$, from a single emitter,
$\gamma_1$, and a pair, $\gamma_2$. We show that small relative errors in
$\gamma_1$ (i.e., $\varepsilon\approx0.5\%$), due to the finite domain size,
are sufficient to alter the functional dependence $\delta(c)$, where $c$ is the
distance from the emitters in the pair. We show that $\delta(c)$ obeys a
recently proposed power law decay in the limit of infinite domain size
($\varepsilon=0$, say), in contrast to a long time established exponential
decay. Thus, power law functional dependence, $-\delta \sim c^{-n}$, with
$n=3$, is suggested to be a universal signature of the charge-blunting effect,
at sufficient large distances between similar emitters with any shape. These
results explain the origin of the discrepancies in the literature and improves
the scientific understanding of the field electron emission theory, for
accurate characterization of emitters in small clusters or arrays.

Shuffled Graph Classification: Theory and Connectome Applications,"  We develop a formalism to address statistical pattern recognition of graph
valued data. Of particular interest is the case of all graphs having the same
number of uniquely labeled vertices. When the vertex labels are latent, such
graphs are called shuffled graphs. Our formalism provides insight to trivially
answer a number of open statistical questions including: (i) under what
conditions does shuffling the vertices degrade classification performance and
(ii) do universally consistent graph classifiers exist? The answers to these
questions lead to practical heuristic algorithms with state-of-the-art finite
sample performance, in agreement with our theoretical asymptotics.

An observational detection of the bridge effect of void filaments,"  The bridge effect of void filaments is a phrase coined by Park & Lee (2009b)
to explain the correlations found in a numerical experiment between the
luminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of their
host filaments. Their numerical finding implies that a straight void filament
provides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matter
particles from the surroundings into the void galaxies. Analyzing the Sloan
void catalog constructed by Pan et al (2012), we identify the filamentary
structures in void regions and determine the specific size of each void
filament as a measure of its straightness. To avoid possible spurious signals
caused by the Malmquist bias, we consider only those void filaments whose
redshifts are in the range of 0=< z <= 0.02 and find a clear tendency that the
void galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average more
luminous, which is in qualitative agreement with the numerical prediction. It
is also shown that the strength of correlation increases with the number of the
member galaxies of the void filaments, which can be physically understood on
the grounds that the more stretched filaments can connect the dense
surroundings even to the galaxies located deep in the central parts of the
voids. This observational evidence may provide a key clue to the puzzling issue
of why the void galaxies have higher specific star formation rates and bluer
colors than their wall counterparts.

"Protein sequestration versus Hill-type repression in circadian clock
  models","  Circadian (~24hr) clocks are self-sustained endogenous oscillators with which
organisms keep track of daily and seasonal time. Circadian clocks frequently
rely on interlocked transcriptional- translational feedback loops to generate
rhythms that are robust against intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. To
investigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the intracellular feedback loops in
circadian clocks, a number of mathematical models have been developed. The
majority of the models use Hill functions to describe transcriptional
repression in a way that is similar to the Goodwin model. Recently, a new class
of models with protein sequestration-based repression has been introduced.
Here, we discuss how this new class of models differs dramatically from those
based on Hill-type repression in several fundamental aspects: conditions for
rhythm generation, robust network designs and the periods of coupled
oscillators. Consistently, these fundamental properties of circadian clocks
also differ among Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals depending on their key
transcriptional repression mechanisms (Hill-type repression or protein
sequestration). Based on both theoretical and experimental studies, this review
highlights the importance of careful modeling of transcriptional repression
mechanisms in molecular circadian clocks.

"Initial Analysis of a Simple Numerical Model that Exhibits Antifragile
  Behavior","  I present a simple numerical model based on iteratively updating subgroups of
a population, individually modeled by nonnegative real numbers, by a constant
decay factor; however, at each iteration, one group is selected to instead be
updated by a constant growth factor. I discover a relationship between these
variables and their respective probabilities for a given subgroup, summarized
as the variable $c$. When $c>1$, the subgroup is found to tend towards
behaviors reminiscent of antifragility; when at least one subgroup of the
population has $c\ge1$, the population as a whole tends towards significantly
higher probabilities of ""living forever,"" although it may first suffer a drop
in population size as less robust, fragile subgroups ""die off."" In concluding,
I discuss the limitations and ethics of such a model, notably the implications
of when an upper limit is placed on the growth constant, requiring a population
to facilitate an increase in the decay factor to lessen the impact of periods
of failure.

Uniform Shock Waves in Disordered Granular Matter,"  The confining pressure $P$ is perhaps the most important parameter
controlling the properties of granular matter. Strongly compressed granular
media are, in many respects, simple solids in which elastic perturbations
travel as ordinary phonons. However, the speed of sound in granular aggregates
continuously decreases as the confining pressure decreases, completely
vanishing at the jamming-unjamming transition. This anomalous behavior suggests
that the transport of energy at low pressures should not be dominated by
phonons. In this work we use simulations and theory to show how the response of
granular systems becomes increasingly nonlinear as pressure decreases. In the
low pressure regime the elastic energy is found to be mainly transported
through nonlinear waves and shocks. We numerically characterize the propagation
speed, shape, and stability of these shocks, and model the dependence of the
shock speed on pressure and impact intensity by a simple analytical approach.

Two Gaps Make a High Temperature Superconductor?,"  One of the keys to the high-temperature superconductivity puzzle is the
identification of the energy scales associated with the emergence of a coherent
condensate of superconducting electron pairs. These might provide a measure of
the pairing strength and of the coherence of the superfluid, and ultimately
reveal the nature of the elusive pairing mechanism in the superconducting
cuprates. To this end, a great deal of effort has been devoted to investigating
the connection between the superconducting transition temperature Tc and the
normal-state pseudogap crossover temperature T*. Here we present a review of a
large body of experimental data that suggests a coexisting two-gap scenario,
i.e. superconducting gap and pseudogap, over the whole superconducting dome.

"First law and Smarr formula of black hole mechanics in nonlinear gauge
  theories","  Motivated by the fact that Bardeen black holes do not satisfy the usual first
law and Smarr formula, we derive a generalized first law from the Lagrangian of
nonlinear gauge field coupled to gravity. In our treatment, the Lagrangian is a
function of the electromagnetic invariant as well as some additional
parameters. Consequently, we obtain new terms in the first law. With our
formula, we find the correct forms of the first law for Bardeen black holes and
Born-Infeld black holes. By scaling arguments, we also derive a general Smarr
formula from the first law. Our results apply to a wide class of black holes
with nonlinear gauge fields.

"Fundamental properties of solar-like oscillating stars from frequencies
  of minimum $\Delta \nu$ : II. Model computations for different chemical
  compositions and mass","  The large separations between the oscillation frequencies of solar-like stars
are measures of stellar mean density. The separations have been thought to be
mostly constant in the observed range of frequencies. However, detailed
investigation shows that they are not constant, and their variations are not
random but have very strong diagnostic potential for our understanding of
stellar structure and evolution. In this regard, frequencies of the minimum
large separation are very useful tools. From these frequencies, in addition to
the large separation and frequency of maximum amplitude, Y\i ld\i z et al.
recently have developed new methods to find almost all the fundamental stellar
properties. In the present study, we aim to find metallicity and helium
abundances from the frequencies, and generalize the relations given by Y\i ld\i
z et al. for a wider stellar mass range and arbitrary metallicity ($Z$) and
helium abundance ($Y$). We show that the effect of metallicity is {
significant} for most of the fundamental parameters. For stellar mass, for
example, the expression must be multiplied by $(Z/Z_{\sun})^{0.12}$. For
arbitrary helium abundance, $ M \propto (Y/Y_{\sun})^{0.25} $. Methods for
determination of $Z$ and $Y$ from pure asteroseismic quantities are based on
amplitudes (differences between maximum and minimum values of \Dnu) in the
oscillatory component in the spacing of oscillation frequencies. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the difference between the first maximum and the second
minimum is very sensitive to $Z$. It also depends on $\nu_{\rm min1}/\nu_{\rm
max}$ and small separation between the frequencies. Such a dependence leads us
to develop a method to find $Z$ (and $Y$) from oscillation frequencies. The
maximum difference between the estimated and model $Z$ values is about 14 per
cent. It is 10 per cent for $Y$.

"Kinematics of Simulated Galaxies I: Connecting Dynamical and
  Morphological Properties of Early-Type Galaxies at Different Redshifts","  State-of-the-art integral field surveys like $\mathrm{ATLAS^{3D}}$, SLUGGS,
CALIFA, SAMI, and MaNGA provide large data sets of kinematical observations of
early-type galaxies (ETGs), yielding constraints on the formation of ETGs.
Using the cosmological hydrodynamical \textit{Magneticum Pathfinder}
simulations, we investigate the paradigm of fast and slow rotating ETGs in a
fully cosmological context. We show that the ETGs within the
\textit{Magneticum} simulation are in remarkable agreement with the
observations, revealing fast and slow rotators quantified by the angular
momentum proxy $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the flattening $\epsilon$ with the
observed prevalence. Taking full advantage of the three-dimensional data, we
demonstrate that the dichotomy between fast and slow rotating galaxies gets
enhanced, showing an upper and lower population separated by an underpopulated
region in the edge-on $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane. Following the
evolution of the $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane through cosmic time,
we find that, while the upper population is already in place at $z=2$, the
lower population gets statistically significant below $z=1$ with a gradual
increase. At least $50\%$ of the galaxies transition from fast to slow rotators
on a short timescale, in most cases associated to a significant merger event.
Furthermore, we connect the $M_{*}$-$j_{*}$ plane, quantified by the $b$-value,
with the $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane, revealing a strong
correlation between the position of a galaxy in the
$\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane and the $b$-value. Going one step
further, we classify our sample based on features in their velocity map,
finding all five common kinematic groups, also including the recently observed

"System size dependence of nuclear modification and azimuthal anisotropy
  of jet quenching","  We investigate the system size dependence of jet-quenching by analyzing
transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ =200 GeV for different centralities. The fast partons
are assumed to lose energy by radiating gluons as they traverse the plasma and
undergo multiple collisions. The energy loss per collision, $\epsilon$, is
taken as proportional to $E$(where $E$ is the energy of the parton),
proportional to $\sqrt{E}$, or a constant depending on whether the formation
time of the gluon is less than the mean path, greater than the mean free path
but less than the path length, or greater than the path length of the partons,
respectively. NLO pQCD is used to evaluate pion production by modifying the
fragmentation function to account for the energy loss. We reproduce the nuclear
modification factor $R_\textrm{AA}$ by treating $\epsilon$ as the only free
parameter, depending on the centrality and the mechanism of energy loss. These
values are seen to explain the nuclear modification of prompt photons, caused
by the energy lost by final state quarks before they fragment into photons.
These also reproduce the azimuthal asymmetry of transverse momentum
distribution for pions within a factor of two and for prompt photons in a fair
agreement with experimental data.

"Lefschetz-thimble approach to the Silver Blaze problem of one-site
  fermion model","  The sign problem of finite-density QCD at the zero temperature becomes very
severe if the quark chemical potential exceeds half of the pion mass. In order
to understand its property, we consider the sign problem of the one-site
fermion model appearing in its path-integral expression by using the
Lefschetz-thimble method. We show that the original integration cycle becomes
decomposed into multiple Lefschetz thimbles at a certain value of the fermion
chemical potential, which would correspond to half of the pion mass of
finite-density QCD. This triggers a fictitious phase transition on each
Lefschetz thimble, and the interference of complex phases among them plays an
important role for the correct description of the system. We also show that the
complex Langevin method does not work in this situation.

Theory of Interacting Cavity Rydberg Polaritons,"  Photonic materials are an emerging platform to explore quantum matter and
quantum dynamics. The development of Rydberg electromagnetically induced
transparency provided a clear route to strong interactions between individual
optical photons. In conjunction with carefully designed optical resonators, it
is now possible to achieve extraordinary control of the properties of
individual photons, introducing tunable gauge fields whilst imbuing the photons
with mass and embedding them on curved spatial manifolds. Building on work
formalizing Rydberg-mediated interactions between propagating photons, we
develop a theory of interacting Rydberg polaritons in multimode optical
resonators, where the strong interactions are married with tunable
single-particle properties to build and probe exotic matter. In the presence of
strong coupling between the resonator field and a Rydberg-dressed atomic
ensemble, a quasiparticle called the ""cavity Rydberg polariton"" emerges. We
investigate its properties, finding that it inherits both the fast dynamics of
its photonic constituents and the strong interactions of its atomic
constituents. We develop tools to properly renormalize the interactions when
polaritons approach each other, and investigate the impact of atomic motion on
the coherence of multi-mode polaritons, showing that most channels for
atom-polariton cross-thermalization are strongly suppressed. Finally, we
propose to harness the repeated diffraction and refocusing of the optical
resonator to realize interactions which are local in momentum space. This work
points the way to efficient modeling of polaritonic quantum materials in
properly renormalized strongly interacting effective theories, thereby enabling
experimental studies of photonic fractional quantum Hall fluids and crystals,
plus photonic quantum information processors and repeaters.

"Bayesian Variable Selection for Ultrahigh-dimensional Sparse Linear
  Models","  We propose a Bayesian variable selection procedure for ultrahigh-dimensional
linear regression models. The number of regressors involved in regression,
$p_n$, is allowed to grow exponentially with $n$. Assuming the true model to be
sparse, in the sense that only a small number of regressors contribute to this
model, we propose a set of priors suitable for this regime. The model selection
procedure based on the proposed set of priors is shown to be variable selection
consistent when all the $2^{p_n}$ models are considered. In the
ultrahigh-dimensional setting, selection of the true model among all the
$2^{p_n}$ possible ones involves prohibitive computation. To cope with this, we
present a two-step model selection algorithm based on screening and Gibbs
sampling. The first step of screening discards a large set of unimportant
covariates, and retains a smaller set containing all the active covariates with
probability tending to one. In the next step, we search for the best model
among the covariates obtained in the screening step. This procedure is
computationally quite fast, simple and intuitive. We demonstrate competitive
performance of the proposed algorithm for a variety of simulated and real data
sets when compared with several frequentist, as well as Bayesian methods.

"Growth dynamics and thickness-dependent electronic structure of
  topological insulator Bi2Te3 thin films on Si","  We use real-time reflection high energy electron diffraction intensity
oscillation to establish the Te-rich growth dynamics of topological insulator
thin films of Bi2Te3 on Si(111) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. In situ
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling
microscopy and ex situ transport measurements reveal that the as-grown Bi2Te3
films without any doping are an intrinsic topological insulator with its Fermi
level intersecting only the metallic surface states. Experimentally, we find
that the single-Dirac-cone surface state develops at a thickness of two
quintuple layers (2 QL). Theoretically, we show that the interaction between
the surface states from both sides of the film, which is determined by the
penetration depth of the topological surface state wavefunctions, sets this
lower thickness limit.

Converting a real quantum bath to an effective classical noise,"  We present a cluster expansion method for approximating quantum spin-bath
dynamics in terms of a classical Gaussian stochastic process. The cluster
expansion produces the two-point correlation function of the approximate
classical bath, permitting rapid evaluation of noise-mitigating quantum control
strategies without resorting to computationally intensive dynamical decoupling
models. Our approximation is valid for the wide class of models possessing
negligible back-action and nearly-Gaussian noise. We study several instances of
the central spin decoherence problem in which the central spin and
randomly-located bath spins are alike and dipolarly coupled. For various pulse
sequences, we compare the coherence echo decay computed explicitly quantum
mechanically versus those computed using our approximate classical model, and
obtain agreement in most, but not all, cases. We demonstrate the utility of
these classical noise models by efficiently searching for the 4-pulse sequences
that maximally mitigate decoherence in each of these cases, a computationally
expensive task in the explicit quantum model.

First Principles Study of SnO Under High Pressure,"  This article reports the study of SnO by using the first-principles
pseudopotential plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA). We have calculated the structural, elastic, electronic and optical of
SnO under high pressure. The elastic properties such as the elastic constants
Cij bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young modulus, anisotropic factor, Pugh ratio,
Poisson ratio are calculated and analyzed. Mechanical stability of SnO at all
pressure are confirmed by using Born stability criteria in terms of elastic
constants and are associated with ductile behaviour based on G/B ratios. It is
also found that SnO exhibits very high anisotropy. The energy band structure
and density of states are also calculated and analyzed. The results show the
semiconducting and metallic properties at 0 (zero) and high pressure,
respectively. Furthermore, the optical properties such as dielectric function,
refractive index, photoconductivity, absorption coefficients, loss function and
reflectivity are also calculated. All the results are compared with those of
the SnO where available but most of the results at high pressure are not
compared due to unavailability of the results.

"The fragmenting past of the disk at the Galactic Center : The culprit
  for the missing red giants","  Since 1996 we have known that the Galactic Center (GC) displays a core-like
distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars starting at ~ 10"", which poses a
theoretical problem, because the GC should have formed a segregated cusp of old
stars. This issue has been addressed invoking stellar collisions, massive black
hole binaries, and infalling star clusters, which can explain it to some
extent. Another observational fact, key to the work presented here, is the
presence of a stellar disk at the GC. We postulate that the reason for the
missing stars in the RGB is closely intertwined with the disk formation, which
initially was gaseous and went through a fragmentation phase to form the stars.
Using simple analytical estimates, we prove that during fragmentation the disk
developed regions with densities much higher than a homogeneous gaseous disk,
i.e. ""clumps"", which were optically thick, and hence contracted slowly. Stars
in the GC interacted with them and in the case of RGB stars, the clumps were
dense enough to totally remove their outer envelopes after a relatively low
number of impacts. Giant stars in the horizontal branch (HB), however, have
much denser envelopes. Hence, the fragmentation phase of the disk must have had
a lower impact in their distribution, because it was more difficult to remove
their envelopes. We predict that future deeper observations of the GC should
reveal less depletion of HB stars and that the released dense cores of RGB
stars will still be populating the GC.

Fields (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, a powerful cosmic lens that has

has an estimated stellar mass of (7 +/- 2)X10E8 Msun, and was formed at z=13.2

from the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) catalogue . We measure absolute
physical and orbital parameters for this system based on archival $V$-band and
$I$-band ASAS photometry, as well as on high-resolution spectroscopic data
obtained with ESO 3.6m/HARPS and CORALIE spectrographs. The physical and
orbital parameters of the system were derived with an accuracy of about 0.5 -
3%. The system is a very rare configuration of two bright well-detached giants
of spectral types K1 and K4 and luminosity class II. The radii of the stars are
$R_1$ = 52.12 $\pm$ 1.38 and $R_2$ = 67.63 $\pm$ 1.40 R$_\odot$ and their
masses are $M_1$ = 4.914 $\pm$ 0.021 and $M_2$ = 4.875$\pm$ 0.021 M$_\odot$ .
The exquisite accuracy of 0.5% obtained for the masses of the components is one
of the best mass determinations for giants. We derived a precise distance to
the system of 2.14 $\pm$ 0.06 kpc (stat.) $\pm$ 0.05 (syst.) which places the
star in the Sagittarius-Carina arm. The Galactic rotational velocity of the
star is $\Theta_s=258 \pm 26$ km s$^{-1}$ assuming $\Theta_0=238$ km s$^{-1}$.
A comparison with PARSEC isochrones places the system at the early phase of
core helium burning with an age of slightly larger than 100 million years. The
effect of overshooting on stellar evolutionary tracks was explored using the
MESA star code.

"GTC/CanariCam mid-IR imaging of the fullerene-rich Planetary Nebula IC
  418: searching for the spatial distribution of fullerene-like molecules","  We present seeing-limited narrow-band mid-IR GTC/CanariCam images of the
spatially extended fullerene-containing planetary nebula (PN) IC 418. The
narrow-band images cover the C60 fullerene band at 17.4 {\mu}m, the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon like (PAH-like) feature at 11.3 {\mu}m, the broad 9-13
{\mu}m feature, and their adjacent continua at 9.8 and 20.5 {\mu}m. We study
the relative spatial distribution of these complex species, all detected in the
Spitzer and Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) spectra of IC 418, with the aim of
getting observational constraints to the formation process of fullerenes in
H-rich circumstellar environments. A similar ring-like extended structure is
seen in all narrow-band filters, except in the dust continuum emission at 9.8
{\mu}m, which peaks closer to the central star. The continuum-subtracted images
display a clear ring-like extended structure for the carrier of the broad 9-13
{\mu}m emission, while the spatial distribution of the (PAH-like) 11.3 {\mu}m
emission is not so well defined. Interestingly, a residual C60 17.4 {\mu}m
emission (at about 4-{\sigma} from the sky background) is seen when subtracting
the dust continuum emission at 20.5 {\mu}m. This residual C60 emission, if
real, might have several interpretations; the most exciting being perhaps that
other fullerene-based species like hydrogenated fullerenes with very low
H-content may contribute to the observed 17.4 {\mu}m emission. We conclude that
higher sensitivity mid-IR images and spatially resolved spectroscopic

Explosive spreading on complex networks: the role of synergy,"  In spite of the vast literature on spreading dynamics on complex networks,
the role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined
produce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been
studied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. Reversible spreading
dynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.
To fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local
synergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,
in which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an
infected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a
number of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the
synergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical
results. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the
strength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the
steady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate
exhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In
fact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the
invasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical
understanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated
hysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.

Finite-size effects and switching times for Moran dynamics with mutation,"  We consider the Moran process with two populations competing under an
iterated Prisoners' Dilemma in the presence of mutation, and concentrate on the
case where there are multiple Evolutionarily Stable Strategies. We perform a
complete bifurcation analysis of the deterministic system which arises in the
infinite population size. We also study the Master equation and obtain
asymptotics for the invariant distribution and metastable switching times for
the stochastic process in the case of large but finite population. We also show
that the stochastic system has asymmetries in the form of a skew for parameter
values where the deterministic limit is symmetric.

"Local risk-minimization for Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard models with
  volatility risk premium","  We derive representations of local risk-minimization of call and put options
for Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard models: jump type stochastic volatility
models whose squared volatility process is given by a non-Gaussian
rnstein-Uhlenbeck process. The general form of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard
models includes two parameters: volatility risk premium $\beta$ and leverage
effect $\rho$. Arai and Suzuki (2015, arxiv:1503.08589) dealt with the same
problem under constraint $\beta=-\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we relax the
restriction on $\beta$; and restrict $\rho$ to $0$ instead. We introduce a
Malliavin calculus under the minimal martingale measure to solve the problem.

"Full-field implementation of a perfect eavesdropper on a quantum
  cryptography system","  Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties to grow a shared
secret key. Its security is founded on the principles of quantum mechanics, but
in reality it significantly relies on the physical implementation.
Technological imperfections of QKD systems have been previously explored, but
no attack on an established QKD connection has been realized so far. Here we
show the first full-field implementation of a complete attack on a running QKD
connection. An installed eavesdropper obtains the entire 'secret' key, while
none of the parameters monitored by the legitimate parties indicate a security
breach. This confirms that non-idealities in physical implementations of QKD
can be fully practically exploitable, and must be given increased scrutiny if
quantum cryptography is to become highly secure.

"The divided cell algorithm and the inhomogeneous Lagrange and Markoff
  spectra","  The divided cell algorithm was introduced by Delone in 1947 to calculate the
inhomogeneous minima of binary quadratic forms and developed further by E. S.
Barnes and H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer in the 1950s. We show how advances of the
past fifty years in both symbolic computation and our understanding of
homogeneous spectra can be combined to make divided cells more useful for
organizing information about inhomogeneous approximation problems. A crucial
part of our analysis relies on work of Jane Pitman, who related the divided
cell algorithm to the regular continued fraction algorithm. In particular, the
relation to continued fractions allows two divided cells for the same problem
to be compared without stepping through the chain of divided cells connecting
them.

Relational Data Mining Through Extraction of Representative Exemplars,"  With the growing interest on Network Analysis, Relational Data Mining is
becoming an emphasized domain of Data Mining. This paper addresses the problem
of extracting representative elements from a relational dataset. After defining
the notion of degree of representativeness, computed using the Borda
aggregation procedure, we present the extraction of exemplars which are the
representative elements of the dataset. We use these concepts to build a
network on the dataset. We expose the main properties of these notions and we
propose two typical applications of our framework. The first application
consists in resuming and structuring a set of binary images and the second in
mining co-authoring relation in a research team.

"Charge Imbalance in a Layered Structure of High Temperature
  Superconductors","  Quasiparticle injection devices are considered as one of the candidates for
the high temperature superconductor transistors, which can operate at liquid
nitrogen temperatures. In these devices the nonequilibrium effects are created
by injecting quasiparticle current into a stack of intrinsic Josephson
junctions (IJJs). These effects lead to an occurrence of a shift of the
condensate chemical potential and a difference in the distribution between the
electron-like and the hole-like quasiparticles that causes a charge imbalance.
Such effects are observed in many experiments for both bulk and layered
superconductors. In this paper, we study non-stationary nonequilibrium charge
imbalance effect due to current injection in a stack of IJJs. We investigate
the effect of the charge imbalance on the current-voltage characteristic (IVC)
and the time dependence of the voltage and the quasiparticle potential in a
stack of five IJJs.

"#Santiago is not #Chile, or is it? A Model to Normalize Social Media
  Impact","  Online social networks are known to be demographically biased. Currently
there are questions about what degree of representativity of the physical
population they have, and how population biases impact user-generated content.
In this paper we focus on centralism, a problem affecting Chile. Assuming that
local differences exist in a country, in terms of vocabulary, we built a
methodology based on the vector space model to find distinctive content from
different locations, and use it to create classifiers to predict whether the
content of a micro-post is related to a particular location, having in mind a
geographically diverse selection of micro-posts. We evaluate them in a case
study where we analyze the virtual population of Chile that participated in the
Twitter social network during an event of national relevance: the municipal
(local governments) elections held in 2012. We observe that the participating
virtual population is spatially representative of the physical population,
implying that there is centralism in Twitter. Our classifiers out-perform a non
geographically-diverse baseline at the regional level, and have the same
accuracy at a provincial level. However, our approach makes assumptions that
need to be tested in multi-thematic and more general datasets. We leave this
for future work.

Partisan Sharing: Facebook Evidence and Societal Consequences,"  The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people seek out information
that supports their views and eschew information that conflicts with their
beliefs, and that has negative consequences on our society. Few researchers
have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media:
users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what
happens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure,
though. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the
partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the
tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid
conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan
sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on
their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and
4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong
evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the
real world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political
program, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70
individuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan
sharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality. However, we
do also find positive aspects of partisan sharing: it is associated with people
who are more knowledgeable about politics and engage more with it as they are
more likely to vote in the general elections.

"Integrative Semantic Dependency Parsing via Efficient Large-scale
  Feature Selection","  Semantic parsing, i.e., the automatic derivation of meaning representation
such as an instantiated predicate-argument structure for a sentence, plays a
critical role in deep processing of natural language. Unlike all other top
systems of semantic dependency parsing that have to rely on a pipeline
framework to chain up a series of submodels each specialized for a specific
subtask, the one presented in this article integrates everything into one
model, in hopes of achieving desirable integrity and practicality for real
applications while maintaining a competitive performance. This integrative
approach tackles semantic parsing as a word pair classification problem using a
maximum entropy classifier. We leverage adaptive pruning of argument candidates
and large-scale feature selection engineering to allow the largest feature
space ever in use so far in this field, it achieves a state-of-the-art
performance on the evaluation data set for CoNLL-2008 shared task, on top of
all but one top pipeline system, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness.

"Categorical concepts and their generalization by means of game theory
  (german: Kategorien-Konzepte und ihre spieltheoretische Verallgemeinerung)","  This paper deals with different concepts for characterizing the size of
mathematical objects. A game theoretic investigation and generalization of two
size concepts, which can both be formulated in topological terms, is provided:
the so called ""Baire category"" and the ""$\sigma $-category"". This is mainly
done by means of (generalized) Banach-Mazur games using the Axiom of
determinacy (the inconsistency of AC and AD is reflected in the beginning and a
weaker form of AC is chosen for proofs). Analogue versions of Cantor-Bendixson
and Heine-Borel are proofed as well as some definability results.
  Such size concepts are established f.i. in measure and integration theory,
set theory and topology often leading to mathematically precise formulations of
""fuzziness"". In measure and integration theory f.i. one defines for a ""measure
space"" $(\Omega, \underline{A}, \mu)$ - i.e. $\Omega$ is a non empty set,
$\underline{A}$ a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ and $\mu$ a measure on
$(\Omega,\underline{A})$ - and a property $E \subset \Omega$ of elements of
$\Omega$, that the property $E$ is valid in a set $A\in\underline{A}$
""$\mu$-almost everywhere"", if $E$ is true in $A$ up to a ""$\mu$-null set"" -
i.e. $\exists N\in\underline{A}{ } (\mu(N)=0 \wedge A\cap N^\complement \subset
E)$. This is crucial for the formulation of uniqueness statements in measure
and integration theory as its theorems usually only apply up to ""small""
($\mu$-null) sets.

Random walk attachment graphs,"  We consider the random walk attachment graph introduced by Saram\""{a}ki and
Kaski and proposed as a mechanism to explain how behaviour similar to
preferential attachment may appear requiring only local knowledge. We show that
if the length of the random walk is fixed then the resulting graphs can have
properties significantly different from those of preferential attachment
graphs, and in particular that in the case where the random walks are of length
1 and each new vertex attaches to a single existing vertex the proportion of
vertices which have degree 1 tends to 1, in contrast to preferential attachment
models. AMS 2010 Subject Classification: Primary 05C82. Key words and

Efficient Quantum Tensor Product Expanders and k-designs,"  Quantum expanders are a quantum analogue of expanders, and k-tensor product
expanders are a generalisation to graphs that randomise k correlated walkers.
Here we give an efficient construction of constant-degree, constant-gap quantum
k-tensor product expanders. The key ingredients are an efficient classical
tensor product expander and the quantum Fourier transform. Our construction
works whenever k=O(n/log n), where n is the number of qubits. An immediate
corollary of this result is an efficient construction of an approximate unitary
k-design, which is a quantum analogue of an approximate k-wise independent
function, on n qubits for any k=O(n/log n). Previously, no efficient
constructions were known for k>2, while state designs, of which unitary designs
are a generalisation, were constructed efficiently in [Ambainis, Emerson 2007].

Constructive role of non-adiabaticity for quantized charge pumping,"  We investigate a recently developed scheme for quantized charge pumping based

fundamentally required to realize single-parameter pumping, while in previous
multi-parameter pumping schemes it caused unwanted and less controllable
currents. In this paper we demonstrate experimentally the constructive and
destructive role of non-adiabaticity by analysing the pumping current over a
broad frequency range.

determine general LSUSY transformations for linear vector supermutiplets with
general auxiliary fields in extended SUSY, where the closure of the commutator
algebras for NLSUSY plays a crucial role.

"Mixtures, envelopes, and hierarchical duality","  We develop a connection between mixture and envelope representations of
objective functions that arise frequently in statistics. We refer to this
connection using the term ""hierarchical duality."" Our results suggest an
interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between marginalization
and profiling, or equivalently between the Fenchel--Moreau theorem for convex
functions and the Bernstein--Widder theorem for Laplace transforms. We give
several different sets of conditions under which such a duality result obtains.
We then extend existing work on envelope representations in several ways,
including novel generalizations to variance-mean models and to multivariate
Gaussian location models. This turns out to provide an elegant missing-data
interpretation of the proximal gradient method, a widely used algorithm in
machine learning. We show several statistical applications in which the
proposed framework leads to easily implemented algorithms, including a robust
version of the fused lasso, nonlinear quantile regression via trend filtering,
and the binomial fused double Pareto model. Code for the examples is available
on GitHub at https://github.com/jgscott/hierduals.

"Proof of a modular relation between 1-, 2- and 3-loop Feynman diagrams
  on a torus","  The coefficients of the higher-derivative terms in the low energy expansion
of genus-one graviton Type II superstring scattering amplitudes are determined
by integrating sums of non-holomorphic modular functions over the complex
structure modulus of a torus. In the case of the four-graviton amplitude, each
of these modular functions is a multiple sum associated with a Feynman diagram
for a free massless scalar field on the torus. The lines in each diagram join
pairs of vertex insertion points and the number of lines defines its weight
$w$, which corresponds to its order in the low energy expansion. Previous
results concerning the low energy expansion of the genus-one four-graviton
amplitude led to a number of conjectured relations between modular functions of
a given $w$, but different numbers of loops $\le w-1$. In this paper we shall

"Wildness of the problem of classifying nilpotent Lie algebras of vector
  fields in four variables","  Let $\mathbb F$ be a field $\mathbb F $ of characteristic zero. Let
$W_{n}(\mathbb F)$ be the Lie algebra of all $\mathbb F$-derivations with the
Lie bracket $[D_1, D_2]:=D_1D_2-D_2D_1$ on the polynomial ring $\mathbb F [x_1,
\ldots , x_n]$. The problem of classifying finite dimensional subalgebras of
$W_{n}(\mathbb F)$ was solved if $ n\leq 2$ and $\mathbb F=\mathbb C$ or
$\mathbb F=\mathbb R.$ We prove that this problem is wild if $n\geq 4$, which
means that it contains the classical unsolved problem of classifying matrix
pairs up to similarity. The structure of finite dimensional subalgebras of
$W_{n}(\mathbb F)$ is interesting since each derivation in case $\mathbb
F=\mathbb R$ can be considered as a vector field with polynomial coefficients
on the manifold $\mathbb R^{n}.$

Satisfying the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with massive particles,"  In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) questioned the completeness of
quantum mechanics by devising a quantum state of two massive particles with
maximally correlated space and momentum coordinates. The EPR criterion
qualifies such continuous-variable entangled states, where a measurement of one
subsystem seemingly allows for a prediction of the second subsystem beyond the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Up to now, continuous-variable EPR
correlations have only been created with photons, while the demonstration of
such strongly correlated states with massive particles is still outstanding.
Here, we report on the creation of an EPR-correlated two-mode squeezed state in
an ultracold atomic ensemble. The state shows an EPR entanglement parameter of
0.18(3), which is 2.4 standard deviations below the threshold 1/4 of the EPR
criterion. We also present a full tomographic reconstruction of the underlying
many-particle quantum state. The state presents a resource for tests of quantum
nonlocality and a wide variety of applications in the field of
continuous-variable quantum information and metrology.

"Constraints on the Early Terrestrial Surface UV Environment Relevant to
  Prebiotic Chemistry","  The UV environment is a key boundary condition for the origin of life.
However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence
surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multi-layer clear-sky
calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV
surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and
atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can
affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of >10.4; for the same
atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the
equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Surface
conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences.
For climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189 nm is
screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from
variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding
from CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible
levels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off
comparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can
build up to the 1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can
dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H2O
is a robust UV shield for <198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of
other atmospheric gases, fluence <198 nm is only available for cold, dry
atmospheres, meaning sources with emission <198 nm (e.g. ArF eximer lasers) can
only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of
volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H2O
and is available across a broad range of CO2 columns, meaning that mercury
lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in
primordial H2O and CO2 levels.

"Crystal fields, disorder, and antiferromagnetic short-range order in
  Yb0.24Sn0.76Ru","  We report extensive measurements on a new compound (Yb0.24Sn0.76)Ru that
crystallizes in the cubic CsCl structure. Valence band photoemission and L3
x-ray absorption show no divalent component in the 4f configuration of Yb.
Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) indicates that the eight-fold degenerate
J-multiplet of Yb3+ is split by the crystalline electric field (CEF) into a
{\Gamma}7 doublet ground state and a {\Gamma}8 quartet at an excitation energy
20 meV. The magnetic susceptibility can be fit very well by this CEF scheme
under the assumption that a {\Gamma}6 excited state resides at 32 meV; however,
the {\Gamma}8/{\Gamma}6 transition expected at 12 meV was not observed in the
INS. The resistivity follows a Bloch- Gr\""uneisen law shunted by a parallel
resistor, as is typical of systems subject to phonon scattering with no
apparent magnetic scattering. All of these properties can be understood as
representing simple local moment behavior of the trivalent Yb ion. At 1 K,
there is a peak in specific heat that is too broad to represent a magnetic
phase transition, consistent with absence of magnetic reflections in neutron
diffraction. On the other hand, this peak also is too narrow to represent the
Kondo effect in the {\Gamma}7 ground state doublet. On the basis of the
field-dependence of the specific heat, we argue that antiferromagnetic
shortrange order (possibly co-existing with Kondo physics) occurs at low
temperatures. The long-range magnetic order is suppressed because the Yb site
occupancy is below the percolation threshold for this disordered compound.

that allow worst-case complexity results to be proved for convergence to points
that satisfy approximate first-order and second-order optimality conditions.
The complexity results match the best known results in the literature for
second-order methods.

Death by Dynamics: Planetoid-Induced Explosions on White Dwarfs,"  At intervals as short as ten thousand years, each white dwarf (WD) passes
within a solar radius of a planetoid, i.e., a comet, asteroid, or planet.
Gravitational tidal forces tear the planetoid apart; its metal-rich debris
falls onto the WD, enriching the atmosphere. A third of WDs exhibit atmospheric
""pollution"". For roughly every hundred planetoid disruptions, a planetoid
collides with a WD. We simulate a small number of collisions, in which
""death-by-dynamics"" refers to the fate of the planetoid. We also compute the
energies and likely durations of a broad sample of collision events, and
identify detection strategies at optical and X-ray wavelengths. Collisions with
the most massive planetoids can be detected in external galaxies. Some may
trigger nuclear burning. If one in $\sim 10^7-10^8$ of WD-planetoid collisions
creates the conditions needed for a Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia),
""death-by-dynamics"" would also refer to the fate of the WD, and could provide a
novel channel for the production of SN~Ia. We consider the circumstances under
which the rate of SNe~Ia can be increased by interactions with planetoids.

vacua. The backgrounds, found by Bobev et al., are holographically dual to

and are similar to zero-temperature limits of holographic superconductors, but
with a symmetry-breaking source as well. The condensed scalar mixes charged and
neutral fields dual to composite fermionic operators in the Dirac equations.
Both gapped and gapless bands of stable quasiparticles are found.

theory. We also present explicit expressions for the potential gauge anomalies
associated with the tensor gauge fields and classify all possible anomalies
that can appear in lower dimensions. Of special interest are those which can be
constructed in four, six, eight and ten dimensions.

Thin n-in-p planar pixel modules for the ATLAS upgrade at HL-LHC,"  The ATLAS experiment will undergo a major upgrade of the tracker system in
view of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) foreseen to start around
2025. Thin planar pixel modules are promising candidates to instrument the new
pixel system, thanks to the reduced contribution to the material budget and
their high charge collection efficiency after irradiation. New designs of the
pixel cells, with an optimized biasing structure, have been implemented in
n-in-p planar pixel productions with sensor thicknesses of 270 um. Using beam
tests, the gain in hit efficiency is investigated as a function of the received
irradiation fluence. The outlook for future thin planar pixel sensor
productions will be discussed, with a focus on thin sensors with a thickness of
100 and 150 um and a novel design with the optimized biasing structure and
small pixel cells (50 um x 50 um and 25 um x 100 um). These dimensions are
foreseen for the new ATLAS read-out chip in 65 nm CMOS technology and the fine
segmentation will represent a challenge for the tracking in the forward region
of the pixel system at HL-LHC. To predict the performance of 50 um x 50 um
pixels at high eta, FE-I4 compatible planar pixel sensors have been studied
before and after irradiation in beam tests at high incidence angle with respect
to the short pixel direction. Results on cluster shapes, charge collection- and
hit efficiency will be shown.

determined depending on the properties of the analysis and synthesis sequences,
as well as the symbol. Examples which show that the given assertions cover
different classes of multipliers are given. If a multiplier is invertible, a
formula for the inverse operator is determined. The case when one of the
sequences is a Riesz basis is completely characterized.

On the renormalization of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term,"  The bulk (Einstein-Hilbert) and boundary (Gibbons-Hawking) terms in the
gravitational action are generally renormalized differently when integrating
out quantum fluctuations. The former is affected by nonminimal couplings, while
the latter is affected by boundary conditions. We use the heat kernel method to
analyze this behavior for a nonminimally coupled scalar field, the Maxwell
field, and the graviton field. Allowing for Robin boundary conditions, we
examine in which cases the renormalization preserves the ratio of boundary and
bulk terms required for the effective action to possess a stationary point. The
implications for field theory and black hole entropy computations are
discussed.

"A Topological Investigation of Phase Transitions of Cascading Failures
  in Power Grids","  Cascading failures are one of the main reasons for blackouts in electric
power transmission grids. The economic cost of such failures is in the order of
tens of billion dollars annually. The loading level of power system is a key
aspect to determine the amount of the damage caused by cascading failures.
Existing studies show that the blackout size exhibits phase transitions as the
loading level increases. This paper investigates the impact of the topology of
a power grid on phase transitions in its robustness. Three spectral graph
metrics are considered: spectral radius, effective graph resistance and
algebraic connectivity. Experimental results from a model of cascading failures
in power grids on the IEEE power systems demonstrate the applicability of these
metrics to design/optimize a power grid topology for an enhanced phase
transition behavior of the system.

On spacelike and timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$,"  We discuss timelike and spacelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$ using a
Pohlmeyer type reduction. The differential equations for the reduced system are
derived in a parallel treatment of both type of surfaces, with emphasis on
their characteristic differences. In the timelike case we find a formulation
corresponding to a complete gauge fixing of the torsion. In the spacelike case
we derive three sets of equations, related to different parameterizations
enforced by the Lorentzian signature of the metric in normal space. On the
basis of these equations, we prove that there are no flat spacelike minimal
surfaces in $AdS_n, n\geq 4$ beyond the four cusp surfaces used in the
Alday-Maldacena conjecture. Furthermore, we give a parameterization of flat
timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_5$ in terms of two chiral fields.

key ingredient linking the two notions is the structure of quantum geometry at
Planck scale implied by loop quantum gravity, where correlations between the
inside and outside of the black hole are mediated by eigenstates of the horizon

"Analyzing Mobility-Traffic Correlations in Large WLAN Traces: Flutes vs.
  Cellos","  Two major factors affecting mobile network performance are mobility and
traffic patterns. Simulations and analytical-based performance evaluations rely
on models to approximate factors affecting the network. Hence, the
understanding of mobility and traffic is imperative to the effective evaluation
and efficient design of future mobile networks. Current models target either
mobility or traffic, but do not capture their interplay. Many trace-based
mobility models have largely used pre-smartphone datasets (e.g., AP-logs), or
much coarser granularity (e.g., cell-towers) traces. This raises questions
regarding the relevance of existing models, and motivates our study to revisit
this area. In this study, we conduct a multidimensional analysis, to
quantitatively characterize mobility and traffic spatio-temporal patterns, for
laptops and smartphones, leading to a detailed integrated mobility-traffic
analysis. Our study is data-driven, as we collect and mine capacious datasets
(with 30TB, 300k devices) that capture all of these dimensions. The
investigation is performed using our systematic (FLAMeS) framework. Overall,
dozens of mobility and traffic features have been analyzed. The insights and
lessons learnt serve as guidelines and a first step towards future integrated
mobility-traffic models. In addition, our work acts as a stepping-stone towards
a richer, more-realistic suite of mobile test scenarios and benchmarks.

"Experimental set-up of the LUNASKA lunar Cherenkov observations at the
  ATCA","  This contribution describes the experimental set-up implemented by the
LUNASKA project at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to enable the
radio-telescope to be used to search for pulses of coherent Cherenkov radiation
from UHE particle interactions in the Moon with an unprecedented bandwidth, and
hence sensitivity. Our specialised hardware included analogue de-dispersion
filters to coherently correct for the dispersion expected of a ~nanosecond
pulse in the Earth's ionosphere over our wide (600 MHz) bandwidth, and
FPGA-based digitising boards running at 2.048 GHz for pulse detection. The
trigger algorithm is described, as are the methods used discriminate between
terrestrial RFI and true lunar pulses. We also outline the next stage of
hardware development expected to be used in our 2010 observations.

Rydberg dressing of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate,"  We study the influence of Rydberg dressed interactions in a one-dimensional
(1D) Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). We show that a 1D geometry offers several
advantages over 3D for observing BEC Rydberg dressing. The effects of dressing
are studied by investigating collective BEC dynamics after a rapid switch-off
of the Rydberg dressing interaction. The results can be interpreted as an
effective modification of the s-wave scattering length. We include this
modification in an analytical model for the 1D BEC, and compare it to numerical
calculations of Rydberg dressing under realistic experimental conditions.

single component fluid with Yukawa interaction potential. We show that, for a

striking agreement with a simple model of generalized hydrodynamics. Since the
Yukawa potential can describe the ion-ion interactions in a plasma, the model
has significant applicability for both analyzing and interpreting the results
of x-ray scattering data from high power lasers and fourth generation light
sources.

Varieties of Mixing,"  We consider extensions of the notion of topological transitivity for a
dynamical system $(X,f)$. In addition to chain transitivity, we define strong
chain transitivity and vague transitivity. Associated with each there is a
notion of mixing, defined by transitivity of the product system $(X \times X, f
\times f)$. These extend the concept of weak mixing which is associated with
topological transitivity. Using the barrier functions of Fathi and Pageault, we
obtain for each of these extended notions a dichotomy result that a transitive
system of each type either satisfies the corresponding mixing condition or else
factors onto an appropriate type of equicontinuous minimal system. The
classical dichotomy result for minimal systems follows when it is shown that a
minimal system is weak mixing if and only if it is vague mixing.

Metastability limit for the nucleation of NaCl crystals in confinement,"  We study the spontaneous nucleation and growth of sodium chloride crystals
induced by controlled evaporation in confined geometries (microcapillaries)
spanning several orders of magnitude in volume. In all experiments, the
nucleation happens reproducibly at a very high supersaturation S~1.6 and is
independent of the size, shape and surface properties of the microcapillary. We
show from classical nucleation theory that this is expected: S~1.6 corresponds
to the point where nucleation first becomes observable on experimental time
scales. A consequence of the high supersaturations reached at the onset of
nucleation is the very rapid growth of a single skeletal (Hopper) crystal.
Experiments on porous media reveal also the formation of Hopper crystals in the
entrapped liquid pockets in the porous network and consequently underline the
fact that sodium chloride can easily reach high supersaturations, in spite of
what is commonly assumed for this salt.

Influence of Plasma Collective Effects on Cosmological Evolution,"  It is well-known that the universe was in a plasma state both before
decoupling and after reionization. However, the conventional wisdom has been
that the plasma effects are largely Debye-shielded and can thus be safely
ignored when considering large scale evolutions. Recently we showed that large
scale structure formation in the universe may actually be suppressed by the
plasma collective effect. Indeed, observational data indicate that the
conventional theoretical formula tends to overestimate the matter power
spectrum at scales $k>1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. In this paper, we further develop our
theory through a more thorough and general derivation of the
Maxwell-Einstein-Boltzmann equation. In addition to baryon density perturbation
post reionization, we apply this general formulation to investigate the
possible plasma effect on CMB anisotropy. As expected, while the plasma effect
does render an observable effect to the former, its impact on the latter is
totally negligible.

A test for cosmic distance duality,"  Testing the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) constitutes an important
task for cosmology and fundamental physics since any violation of it would be a
clear evidence of new physics. In this {\it Letter}, we propose a new test for
the CDDR using only measurements of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters
from Sunyaev-Zeldovich ($f_{SZE}$) and X-ray surface brightness ($f_{X-ray}$)
observations. We show that the relation between current $f_{X-ray}$ and
$f_{SZE}$ observations is given by $f_{SZE}=\eta f_{X-ray}$, where $\eta$
quantifies deviations from the CDDR. Since this latter expression is valid for
the same object in a given galaxy cluster sample, the method proposed removes
possible contaminations from different systematics error sources and redshift
differences involved in luminosity and angular diameter distance measurements.
We apply this cosmological model-independent methodology to the most recent
$f_{X-ray}$ and $f_{SZE}$ data and show that no significant violation of the
CDDR is found.

"Conductance Discontinuity on the Surface of a Topological Insulator with
  Magnetic Electrodes","  Asymmetric electrical conductance is theoretically demonstrated on the
surface of a topological insulator (TI) in the limit of infinitesimally small
forward and reverse biases between two spin selective electrodes. The
discontinuous behavior relies on the spin-momentum interlocked nature of TI
surface electrons together with the resulting imbalance in the coupling
coefficients between the electrodes and TI surface states. The analysis is
based on a transmission matrix model that, in combination with a
phenomenological treatment for the diffusive limit, accounts for both ballistic
and scattered paths simultaneously. With the estimated conductance asymmetry
over a factor of 10, implementation in the ratchet-like applications and
low-voltage rectification circuits appears practicable.

"Two-dimensional Decoding Algorithms and Recording Techniques for Bit
  Patterned Media Feasibility Demonstrations","  Recording experiments and decoding algorithms are presented for evaluating
the bit-error-rate of state-of-the-art magnetic bitpatterned media. The
recording experiments are performed with a static tester and conventional
hard-disk-drive heads. As the reader dimensions are larger than the bit
dimensions in both the down-track and the cross-track directions, a
two-dimensional bit decoding algorithm is required. Two such algorithms are
presented in details together with the methodology implemented to accurately
retrieve island positions during recording. Using these techniques, a 1.6
Td/in$^2$ magnetic bit pattern media is demonstrated to support 2D bit error
rates below 1e-2 under shingled magnetic recording conditions.

"Calibration of the Mixing-Length Theory for Convective White Dwarf
  Envelopes","  A calibration of the mixing-length parameter in the local mixing-length
theory (MLT) is presented for the lower part of the convection zone in
pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. The parameterization is performed from a
comparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying
mixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted
to the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations
suggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change
significantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately
below the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic
of the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The
calibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the
effective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity
range 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to
reproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of
the 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for
these quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and
envelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and
convective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the
white dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the
degenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are
insensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,
hence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.

Global Minimum Search via Annealing. Nanoscale Gold Clusters,"  Global minimum potential energy state can be very challenging to locate in a
relatively large atomistic system. Our present work investigates this problem
using an example of gold nanoclusters, Au10, Au20, Au30, Au50. Nanoscale gold
particles (NGPs) contribute heavily life sciences through their applications in
diagnostics and therapeutics. NGPs feature manifold atomistic configurations
depending on the conditions of synthesis. We apply annealing molecular dynamics
(AMD) as an alternative and supplement to the well-established eigenfollowing
(EF) geometry optimization. We conclude that the combination of AMD and EF
systematically works more efficiently than EF alone.

"The Joint Diffusion of a Digital Platform and its Complementary Goods:
  The Effects of Product Ratings and Observational Learning","  The authors study the interdependent diffusion of an open source software
(OSS) platform and its software complements. They quantify the role of OSS
governance, quality signals such as product ratings, observational learning,
and user actions upon adoption. To do so they extend the Bass Diffusion Model
and apply it to a unique data set of 6 years of daily downloads of the Firefox
browser and 52 of its add-ons. The study then re-casts the resulting
differential equations into non-linear, discrete-time, state space forms; and
estimate them using an MCMC approach to the Extended Kalman Filtern (EKF-MCMC).
Unlike continuous-time filters, the EKF-MCMC approach avoids numerical
integration, and so is more computational efficient, given the length of our
time-series, high dimension of our state space and need to model heterogeneity.
Results show, for example, that observational learning and add-on ratings
increase the demand for Firefox add-ons; add-ons can increase the market
potential of the Firefox platform; a slow add-on review process can diminish
platform success; and OSS platforms (i.e. Chrome and Firefox) compete rather
than complement each other.

Assessment of Source Code Obfuscation Techniques,"  Obfuscation techniques are a general category of software protections widely
adopted to prevent malicious tampering of the code by making applications more
difficult to understand and thus harder to modify. Obfuscation techniques are
divided in code and data obfuscation, depending on the protected asset. While
preliminary empirical studies have been conducted to determine the impact of
code obfuscation, our work aims at assessing the effectiveness and efficiency
in preventing attacks of a specific data obfuscation technique - VarMerge. We
conducted an experiment with student participants performing two attack tasks
on clear and obfuscated versions of two applications written in C. The
experiment showed a significant effect of data obfuscation on both the time
required to complete and the successful attack efficiency. An application with
VarMerge reduces by six times the number of successful attacks per unit of
time. This outcome provides a practical clue that can be used when applying
software protections based on data obfuscation.

Fractional Heisenberg Equation,"  Fractional derivative can be defined as a fractional power of derivative. The
commutator (i/h)[H, ], which is used in the Heisenberg equation, is a
derivation on a set of observables. A derivation is a map that satisfies the
Leibnitz rule. In this paper, we consider a fractional derivative on a set of
quantum observables as a fractional power of the commutator (i/h)[H, ]. As a
result, we obtain a fractional generalization of the Heisenberg equation. The
fractional Heisenberg equation is exactly solved for the Hamiltonians of free
particle and harmonic oscillator. The suggested Heisenberg equation generalize
a notion of quantum Hamiltonian systems to describe quantum dissipative
processes.

"From deep inelastic scattering to heavy-flavor semi-leptonic decays:
  Total rates into multi-hadron final states from lattice QCD","  We present a new technique for extracting decay and transition rates into
final states with any number of hadrons. The approach is only sensitive to
total rates, in which all out-states with a given set of QCD quantum numbers
are included. For processes involving photons or leptons, differential rates
with respect to the non-hadronic kinematics may also be extracted. Our method
involves constructing a finite-volume Euclidean four-point function, whose
corresponding spectral function measures the decay and transition rates in the
infinite-volume limit. This requires solving the inverse problem of extracting
the spectral function from the correlator and also necessitates a smoothing
procedure so that a well-defined infinite-volume limit exists. Both of these
steps are accomplished by the Backus-Gilbert method and, as we show with a
numerical example, reasonable precision can be expected in cases with multiple
open decay channels. Potential applications include nucleon structure functions

"Dynamical instabilities and quasi-normal modes, a spectral analysis with
  applications to black-hole physics","  Black hole dynamical instabilities have been mostly studied in specific
models. We here study the general properties of the complex-frequency modes
responsible for such instabilities, guided by the example of a charged scalar
field in an electrostatic potential. We show that these modes are square
integrable, have a vanishing conserved norm, and appear in mode doublets or
quartets. We also study how they appear in the spectrum and how their complex
frequencies subsequently evolve when varying some external parameter. When
working on an infinite domain, they appear from the reservoir of quasi-normal
modes obeying outgoing boundary conditions. This is illustrated by
generalizing, in a non-positive definite Krein space, a solvable model
(Friedrichs model) which originally describes the appearance of a resonance
when coupling an isolated system to a mode continuum. In a finite spatial
domain instead, they arise from the fusion of two real frequency modes with
opposite norms, through a process that closely resembles avoided crossing.

"Time resolved spectral analysis of the prompt emission of long gamma ray
  bursts with GeV Emission","  We make a detailed time resolved spectroscopy of bright long gamma ray bursts
(GRBs) which show significant GeV emissions (GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB
090926A). In addition to the standard Band model, we also use a model
consisting of a blackbody and a power-law to fit the spectra. We find that for
the latter model there are indications for an additional soft component in the
spectra. While previous studies have shown that such models are required for
GRB 090902B, here we find that a composite spectral model consisting of two
black bodies and a power law adequately fit the data of all the three bright
GRBs. We investigate the evolution of the spectral parameters and find several
generic interesting features for all three GRBs, like a) temperatures of the
black bodies are strongly correlated to each other, b) flux in the black body
components are strongly correlated to each other, c) the temperatures of the
black body trace the profile of the individual pulses of the GRBs, and d) the
characteristics of the power law component like the spectral index and the
delayed onset bear a close similarity to the emission characteristics in the
GeV regions. We discuss the implications of these results to the possibility of
identifying the radiation mechanisms during the prompt emission of GRBs.

"PRED-CLASS: cascading neural networks for generalized protein
  classification and genome-wide applications","  A cascading system of hierarchical, artificial neural networks (named
PRED-CLASS) is presented for the generalized classification of proteins into
four distinct classes-transmembrane, fibrous, globular, and mixed-from
information solely encoded in their amino acid sequences. The architecture of
the individual component networks is kept very simple, reducing the number of
free parameters (network synaptic weights) for faster training, improved
generalization, and the avoidance of data overfitting. Capturing information
from as few as 50 protein sequences spread among the four target classes (6
transmembrane, 10 fibrous, 13 globular, and 17 mixed), PRED-CLASS was able to
obtain 371 correct predictions out of a set of 387 proteins (success rate
approximately 96%) unambiguously assigned into one of the target classes. The
application of PRED-CLASS to several test sets and complete proteomes of
several organisms demonstrates that such a method could serve as a valuable
tool in the annotation of genomic open reading frames with no functional
assignment or as a preliminary step in fold recognition and ab initio structure
prediction methods. Detailed results obtained for various data sets and
completed genomes, along with a web sever running the PRED-CLASS algorithm, can
be accessed over the World Wide Web at http://o2.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-CLASS

"On the HI column density - radio source size anti-correlation in compact
  radio sources","  Existing studies of the atomic hydrogen gas content in distant galaxies,
through the absorption of the 21-cm line, often infer that the total column
density is anti-correlated with the linear extent of the background radio
source. We investigate this interpretation, by dissecting the various
parameters from which the column density is derived, and find that the
relationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth, which, for a
given absorber size, is anti-correlated with the linear size. Therefore, the
inferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry, in conjunction
with the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for each
member of the sample, an assumption for which there is scant observational
justification. While geometry can explain the observed correlation, many radio
sources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two
component emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber. From this, the observed
optical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models which
approximate either of the two Fanaroff & Riley classifications, although the
observed scatter in the sample cannot be duplicated using a single deprojected
radio source size. Furthermore, the trend is best reproduced using an absorber
of diameter ~100 - 1000 pc, which is also the range of values of linear sizes
at which the 21-cm detection rate peaks. This may indicate that this is the
characteristic linear size of the absorbing gas structure.

"Semiclassical theory of magnetoresistance in positionally-disordered
  organic semiconductors","  A recently introduced percolative theory of unipolar organic
magnetoresistance is generalized by treating the hyperfine interaction
semiclassically for an arbitrary hopping rate. Compact analytic results for the
magnetoresistance are achievable when carrier hopping occurs much more
frequently than the hyperfine field precession period. In other regimes, the
magnetoresistance can be straightforwardly evaluated numerically. Slow and fast
hopping magnetoresistance are found to be uniquely characterized by their
lineshapes. We find that the threshold hopping distance is analogous a
phenomenological two-site model's branching parameter, and that the distinction
between slow and fast hopping is contingent on the threshold hopping distance.

For every ultra-metric space and every NA valued field (e.g., the field
$\mathbb Q_{p}$ of $p$-adic numbers) the naturally defined inf-max cost formula
achieves its infimum. We also present NA versions of the Arens-Eells
construction and of the integer value property. We introduce and study free NA
locally convex spaces. In particular, we provide conditions under which these
spaces are normable by Kantorovich ultra-norms and also conditions which yield
NA versions of Tkachenko-Uspenskij theorem about free abelian topological
groups.

The Luminosity Functions and Timescales of MYSOs and Compact HII regions,"  We present a determination of the luminosity functions of massive young
stellar objects (MYSOs) and compact (C)HII regions within the Milky Way Galaxy
using the large, well-selected sample of these sources identified by the Red
MSX Source (RMS) survey. The MYSO luminosity function decreases monotonically
such that there are few with $L\gtrsim 10^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII regions are
detected up to ~10$^{6}Lsol. The lifetimes of these phases are also calculated
as a function of luminosity by comparison with the luminosity function for
local main-sequence OB stars. These indicate that the MYSO phase has a duration
ranging from 4x10$^{5}$ yrs for 10$^{4}$Lsol to ~7x10$^{4}$ yrs at
10$^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII region phase lasts of order 3x10$^{5}$ yrs or
~3-10% of the exciting star's main-sequence lifetime. MYSOs between 10$^{4}
Lsol and ~10$^{5}$ Lsol are massive but do not display the radio continuum or
near-IR \HI{} recombination line emission indicative of an HII region,
consistent with being swollen due to high ongoing or recent accretion rates.
Above ~10$^{5}$ Lsol the MYSO phase lifetime becomes comparable to the
main-sequence Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, at which point the central star can
rapidly contract onto the main-sequence even if still accreting, and ionise a
CHII region, thus explaining why few highly luminous MYSOs are observed.

Graphene-based tortional resonator from molecular dynamics simulation,"  Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study graphene-based
torsional mechanical resonators. The quality factor is calculated by
$Q_{F}=\omega\tau/2\pi$, where the frequency $\omega$ and life time $\tau$ are
obtained from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate. Our
simulations reveal the radius-dependence of the quality factor as
$Q_{F}=2628/(22R^{-1}+0.004R^{2})$, which yields a maximum value at some proper
radius $R$. This maximum point is due to the strong boundary effect in the
torsional resonator, as disclosed by the temperature distribution in the
resonator. Resulting from the same boundary effect, the quality factor shows a
power law temperature-dependence with power factors bellow 1.0. The theoretical
results supply some valuable information for the manipulation of the quality
factor in future experimental devices based on the torsional mechanical
resonator.

Mesoscopic Models of Plants Composed of Metallic Nanowires,"  Various metallic structures of complex shape resembling living plant
organisms (biomimetics) are produced as a result of selfassembly of nanowires
growing on porous membranes in the course of pulse current electrodeposition.
These structures occur if the electroplating is continued after the nanowires
appear on the membrane surface. By varying the membrane ge- ometry, pulse
current electroplating parameters, and alternating electrodeposition from two
baths composed of a variety of electrolytes, diverse models were fabricated,
including a hollow container with a wall thickness of 10 nm to 20 nm. This
biomimetic method suggests an analogy between the shape forming processes of
plants and their metallic models. Nanostruc- tured mesostructures of various
metals (Ag, Pd, Ni), alloys (PdNi, PbIn) and hybrid structures (PdNiPb,
PdNiPbIn) were obtained. They can be of interest for fundamental research
(self-assembly, morphogenesis) as well as for applications in nanotechnology
(catalysis, nanoplasmonics, medicine, superhydrophobic surfaces).

"Global disorder transition in the community structure of large-q Potts
  systems","  We examine a global disorder transition when identifying community structure
in an arbitrary complex network. Earlier, we illustrated [Phil. Mag. 92, 406
(2012)] that ""community detection"" (CD) generally exhibits disordered (or
unsolvable) and ordered (solvable) phases of both high and low computational
complexity along with corresponding transitions from regular to chaotic
dynamics in derived systems. Using an exact generalized dimensional reduction
inequality, multivariate Tutte polynomials, and other considerations, we
illustrate how increasing the number of communities q emulates increasing the
heat bath temperature T for a general weighted Potts model, leading to global
disorder in the community structure of arbitrary large graphs. Dimensional
reduction bounds lead to results similar to those suggested by mean-field type
approaches. Large systems tend toward global insolvability in the limit of
large q above a crossover temperature $T_\times\approx L|J_e|/[N\ln{} q]$ where
|J_e| is a typical interaction strength, L is the number of edges, and N is the
number of nodes. For practical system sizes, a solvable phase is generally
accessible at low T. The global nature of the disorder transition does not
preclude solutions by local CD algorithms (even those that employ global cost
function parameters) as long as community evaluations are locally determined.

temperatures larger than a critical value \beta_c, we give an explicit

then there is a unique KMS_{\beta_c} state, and this state factors through the
quotient map onto the C*-algebra C*(E) of the graph. Our approach is direct and
relatively elementary.

Can dynamical synapses produce true self-organized criticality?,"  Neuronal networks can present activity described by power-law distributed
avalanches presumed to be a signature of a critical state. Here we study a
random-neighbor network of excitable cellular automata coupled by dynamical
synapses. The model exhibits a very similar to conservative self-organized
criticality (SOC) models behavior even with dissipative bulk dynamics. This
occurs because in the stationary regime the model is conservative on average,
and, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability distribution for the global
branching ratio converges to a delta-function centered at its critical value.
So, this non-conservative model pertain to the same universality class of
conservative SOC models and contrasts with other dynamical synapses models that
present only self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Analytical results show
very good agreement with simulations of the model and enable us to study the
emergence of SOC as a function of the parametric derivatives of the stationary
branching ratio.

"Structure and Dynamics of the 13/14 November 2012 Eclipse White-Light
  Corona","  Continuing our series of observations of the motion and dynamics of the solar
corona over the solar-activity cycle, we observed the corona from sites in
Queensland, Australia, during the 13 (UT)/14 (local time) November 2012 total
solar eclipse. The corona took the low-ellipticity shape typical of solar
maximum (flattening index {\epsilon} = 0.01), showing a change from the
composite coronal images that we had observed and analyzed in this journal and
elsewhere for the 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010 eclipses. After crossing the
northeast Australian coast, the rest of the path of totality was over the
ocean, so further totality was seen only by shipborne observers. Our results
include measurements of velocities of a coronal mass ejection; during the 36
minutes of passage from the Queensland coast to a ship north of New Zealand, we
find a speed of 413 km/s, and we analyze its dynamics. We discuss the shapes
and positions of several types of coronal features seen on our
higher-resolution composite Queensland images of the solar corona, including,
many helmet streamers, very faint bright and dark loops at the base of helmet
streamers, voids and radially oriented thin streamers. We compare our eclipse
observations with a hairy-ball model of the magnetic field, confirming the
validity of the prediction, and we relate the eclipse phenomenology seen with
the near-simultaneous images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA), the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on
NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO/EUVI), ESA/ROB's
PROBA2/SWAP, and NRL's LASCO on ESA's SOHO. For example, the southeastern CME

Carrier trapping and luminescence polarization in quantum dashes,"  We study experimentally and theoretically polarization-dependent luminescence
from an ensemble of quantum-dot-like nanostructures with a very large in-plane
shape anisotropy (quantum dashes). We show that the measured degree of linear
polarization of the emitted light increases with the excitation power and
changes with temperature in a non-trivial way, depending on the excitation
conditions. Using an approximate model based on the k.p theory, we are able to
relate this degree of polarization to the amount of light hole admixture in the
exciton states which, in turn, depends on the symmetry of the envelope wave
function. Agreement between the measured properties and theory is reached under
assumption that the ground exciton state in a quantum dash is trapped in a
confinement fluctuation within the structure and thus localized in a much
smaller volume of much lower asymmetry than the entire nanostructure.

Possible explanations for fine-tuning of the universe,"  The Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and the multi-local field theory are
interesting and promising candidates for solving the naturalness problem in the
universe. These theories are based on the different physical principles: The
former assumes the micro-canonical partition function $\int {\cal{D}}\phi\
\prod_i \delta (S_i^{}-I_i^{})$, and the latter assumes the partition function
$\int {\cal{D}}\phi\ \exp\left(iS_M^{}\right)$ where $S_M^{}$ is the
multi-local action $\sum_i c_i^{}S_i^{}+\sum_{i,j}c_{i,j}^{}S_i^{}S_j^{}+\cdots
$. Our main purpose is to show that they are equivalent in the sense that they
predict the same fine-tuning mechanism. In order to clarify our argument, we
first study (review) the similarity between the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and
statistical mechanics in detail, and show that the dynamical fine-tuning in the
former picture can be understood completely in the same way as the
determination of the temperature in the latter picture. Afterward, we discuss
the multi-local theory and the equivalence between it and the the
Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Because the multi-local field theory can be
obtained from physics at the Planck/String scale, this equivalence indicates
that the micro-canonical picture can also originate in such physics. As a
concrete example, we also review the IIB matrix model as an origin of the
multi-local theory.

"Non-equilibrium of Ionization and the Detection of Hot Plasma in
  Nanoflare-heated Coronal Loops","  Impulsive nanoflares are expected to transiently heat the plasma confined in
coronal loops to temperatures of the order of 10 MK. Such hot plasma is hardly
detected in quiet and active regions, outside flares. During rapid and short
heat pulses in rarified loops the plasma can be highly out of equilibrium of
ionization. Here we investigate the effects of the non-equilibrium of
ionization (NEI) on the detection of hot plasma in coronal loops.
Time-dependent loop hydrodynamic simulations are specifically devoted to this
task, including saturated thermal conduction, and coupled to the detailed
solution of the equations of ionization rate for several abundant elements. In
our simulations, initially cool and rarified magnetic flux tubes are heated to
10 MK by nanoflares deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop apex. We
test for different pulse durations, and find that, due to NEI effects, the loop
plasma may never be detected at temperatures above ~5 MK for heat pulses
shorter than about 1 min. We discuss some implications in the framework of
multi-stranded nanoflare-heated coronal loops.

A Radiative Transfer Framework for Spatially-Correlated Materials,"  We introduce a non-exponential radiative framework that takes into account
the local spatial correlation of scattering particles in a medium. Most
previous works in graphics have ignored this, assuming uncorrelated media with
a uniform, random local distribution of particles. However, positive and
negative correlation lead to slower- and faster-than-exponential attenuation
respectively, which cannot be predicted by the Beer-Lambert law. As our results
show, this has a major effect on extinction, and thus appearance. From recent
advances in neutron transport, we first introduce our Extended Generalized
Boltzmann Equation, and develop a general framework for light transport in
correlated media. We lift the limitations of the original formulation,
including an analysis of the boundary conditions, and present a model suitable
for computer graphics, based on optical properties of the media and statistical
distributions of scatterers. In addition, we present an analytic expression for
transmittance in the case of positive correlation, and show how to incorporate
it efficiently into a Monte Carlo renderer. We show results with a wide range
of both positive and negative correlation, and demonstrate the differences
compared to classic light transport.

"Assessment of the GLLB-SC potential for solid-state properties and
  attempts for improvement","  Based on the work of Gritsenko et al. (GLLB) [Phys. Rev. A 51, 1944 (1995)],
the method of Kuisma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 82, 115106 (2010)] to calculate the
band gap in solids was shown to be much more accurate than the common local
density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The
main feature of the GLLB-SC potential (SC stands for solid and correlation) is
to lead to a nonzero derivative discontinuity that can be conveniently
calculated and then added to the Kohn-Sham band gap for a comparison with the
experimental band gap. In this work, a thorough comparison of GLLB-SC with
other methods, e.g., the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential [F. Tran and P.
Blaha, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 226401 (2009)], for electronic, magnetic, and
density-related properties is presented. It is shown that for the band gap,
GLLB-SC does not perform as well as mBJ for systems with a small band gap and
strongly correlated systems, but is on average of similar accuracy as hybrid
functionals. The results on itinerant metals indicate that GLLB-SC
overestimates significantly the magnetic moment (much more than mBJ does), but
leads to excellent results for the electric field gradient, for which mBJ is in
general not recommended. In the aim of improving the results, variants of the
GLLB-SC potential are also tested.

"Total variation approximation for quasi-equilibrium distributions, II","  Quasi-stationary distributions, as discussed by Darroch & Seneta (1965), have
been used in biology to describe the steady state behaviour of population
models which, while eventually certain to become extinct, nevertheless maintain
an apparent stochastic equilibrium for long periods. These distributions have
some drawbacks: they need not exist, nor be unique, and their calculation can
present problems. In an earlier paper, we gave biologically plausible
conditions under which the quasi-stationary distribution is unique, and can be
closely approximated by distributions that are simple to compute. In this
paper, we consider conditions under which the quasi-stationary distribution, if
it exists, need not be unique, but an apparent stochastic equilibrium can
nonetheless be identified and computed; we call such a distribution a
quasi-equilibrium distribution.

"Crash: A Block-Adaptive-Mesh Code for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics -
  Implementation and Verification","  We describe the CRASH (Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics) code, a
block adaptive mesh code for multi-material radiation hydrodynamics. The
implementation solves the radiation diffusion model with the gray or multigroup
method and uses a flux limited diffusion approximation to recover the
free-streaming limit. The electrons and ions are allowed to have different
temperatures and we include a flux limited electron heat conduction. The
radiation hydrodynamic equations are solved in the Eulerian frame by means of a
conservative finite volume discretization in either one, two, or
three-dimensional slab geometry or in two-dimensional cylindrical symmetry. An
operator split method is used to solve these equations in three substeps: (1)
solve the hydrodynamic equations with shock-capturing schemes, (2) a linear
advection of the radiation in frequency-logarithm space, and (3) an implicit
solve of the stiff radiation diffusion, heat conduction, and energy exchange.
We present a suite of verification test problems to demonstrate the accuracy
and performance of the algorithms. The CRASH code is an extension of the
Block-Adaptive Tree Solarwind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) code with this new
radiation transfer and heat conduction library and equation-of-state and
multigroup opacity solvers. Both CRASH and BATS-R-US are part of the publicly
available Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF).

"Compact radio sources and jet-driven AGN feedback in the early Universe:
  Constraints from integral-field spectroscopy","  To investigate the impact of radio jets during the formation epoch of their
massive host galaxies, we present an analysis of two massive, log(M_stel/
M_sun)~10.6 and 11.3, compact radio galaxies at z=3.5, TNJ0205+2242 and
TNJ0121+1320. Their small radio sizes (R<= 10 kpc) are most likely a sign of
youth. We compare their radio properties and gas dynamics with those in well
extended radio galaxies at high redshift, which show strong evidence for
powerful, jet-driven outflows of significant gas masses (M 10^9-10 M_sun). Our
analysis combines rest-frame optical integral-field spectroscopy with existing
radio imaging, CO emission line spectra, and rest-frame UV spectroscopy.
[OIII]5007 line emission is compact in both galaxies and lies within the region
defined by the radio lobes. For TNJ0205+2242, the Ly-alpha profile narrows
significantly outside the jet radius, indicating the presence of a quiescent
halo. TNJ0121+1320 has two components separated by ~10 kpc and a velocity
offset of ~300 km s^-1. If motions are gravitational, this implies a dynamical
mass of 2x10^11 M_sun for the more massive, radio-loud component. The dynamical
mass, molecular gas mass measured from the CO line emission, and radio
luminosity of these two compact radio galaxies imply that compact radio sources
may well develop large-scale, energetic outflows as observed in extended radio
galaxies, with the potential of removing significant fractions of the ISM from
the host galaxy. The absence of luminous emission line gas extending beyond the
radio emission in these sources agrees with the observed timescales and outflow
rates in extended radio galaxies, and adds further evidence that the energetic,
large-scale outflows observed in extended radio sources (Nesvadba et al. 2006)
are indeed the result of influence of the radio jet.

Inductive Logic Boosting,"  Recent years have seen a surge of interest in Probabilistic Logic Programming
(PLP) and Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with
probabilities. Structure learning of these systems is an intersection area of
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and statistical learning (SL). However, ILP
cannot deal with probabilities, SL cannot model relational hypothesis. The
biggest challenge of integrating these two machine learning frameworks is how
to estimate the probability of a logic clause only from the observation of
grounded logic atoms. Many current methods models a joint probability by
representing clause as graphical model and literals as vertices in it. This
model is still too complicate and only can be approximate by pseudo-likelihood.
We propose Inductive Logic Boosting framework to transform the relational
dataset into a feature-based dataset, induces logic rules by boosting Problog
Rule Trees and relaxes the independence constraint of pseudo-likelihood.
Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the AUC-PR and
AUC-ROC value of ILP learned rules are higher than current state-of-the-art SRL
methods.

"Trend extraction in functional data of R and T waves amplitudes of

exercise test undergo strong modifications in response to stress. We analyze
the time series of these amplitudes in a group of normal subjects in the
framework of functional data, performing reduction of dimensionality, smoothing

amplitudes have opposite responses to stress, consisting respectively in a bump
and a dip at the early recovery stage. We test these features computing a
confidence band for the trend of the population mean and analyzing the zero
crossing of its derivative.
  Our findings support the existence of a relationship between R and T wave
amplitudes and respectively diastolic and systolic ventricular volumes.

Seasonality in Dynamic Stochastic Block Models,"  Sociotechnological and geospatial processes exhibit time varying structure
that make insight discovery challenging. This paper proposes a new statistical
model for such systems, modeled as dynamic networks, to address this challenge.
It assumes that vertices fall into one of k types and that the probability of
edge formation at a particular time depends on the types of the incident nodes
and the current time. The time dependencies are driven by unique seasonal
processes, which many systems exhibit (e.g., predictable spikes in geospatial
or web traffic each day). The paper defines the model as a generative process
and an inference procedure to recover the seasonal processes from data when
they are unknown. Evaluation with synthetic dynamic networks show the recovery
of the latent seasonal processes that drive its formation.

rapidity distributions for the dielectron produced from Z'B-L decay channel to
detect Z'B-L signal. B-L extension of SM model predicts by existing Z'B-L heavy
neutral massive boson at high energies and from our results which we had

boson will be found at LHC and has a mass in the range from 1000GeV to 1500GeV.

"Influence of a large-scale field on energy dissipation in
  magnetohydrodynamic turbulence","  In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the large-scale magnetic field sets
a preferred local direction for the small-scale dynamics, altering the
statistics of turbulence from the isotropic case. This happens even in the
absence of a total magnetic flux, since MHD turbulence forms randomly oriented
large-scale domains of strong magnetic field. It is therefore customary to
study small-scale magnetic plasma turbulence by assuming a strong background
magnetic field relative to the turbulent fluctuations. This is done, for
example, in reduced models of plasmas, such as reduced MHD, reduced-dimension
kinetic models, gyrokinetics, etc., which make theoretical calculations easier
and numerical computations cheaper. Recently, however, it has become clear that
the turbulent energy dissipation is concentrated in the regions of strong
magnetic field variations. A significant fraction of the energy dissipation may
be localized in very small volumes corresponding to the boundaries between
strongly magnetized domains. In these regions the reduced models are not
applicable. This has important implications for studies of particle heating and
acceleration in magnetic plasma turbulence. The goal of this work is to
systematically investigate the relationship between local magnetic field
variations and magnetic energy dissipation, and to understand its implications
for modeling energy dissipation in realistic turbulent plasmas.

"Green's functions for far-side seismic images: a polar expansion
  approach","  We have computed seismic images of magnetic activity on the far surface of
the Sun by using a seismic-holography technique. As in previous works, the
method is based on the comparison of waves going in and out of a particular
point in the Sun but we have computed here the Green's functions from a
spherical polar expansion of the adiabatic wave equations in the Cowling
approximation instead of using the ray-path approximation previously used in
the far-side holography. A comparison between the results obtained using the
ray theory and the spherical polar expansion is shown. We use the
gravito-acoustic wave equation in the local plane-parallel limit in both cases
and for the latter we take the asymptotic approximation for the radial
dependencies of the Green's function. As a result, improved images of the
far-side can be obtained from the polar-expansion approximation, especially
when combining the Green's functions corresponding to two and three skips. We
also show that the phase corrections in the Green's functions due to the

Measurement-wise Occlusion in Multi-object Tracking,"  Handling object interaction is a fundamental challenge in practical
multi-object tracking, even for simple interactive effects such as one object
temporarily occluding another. We formalize the problem of occlusion in
tracking with two different abstractions. In object-wise occlusion, objects
that are occluded by other objects do not generate measurements. In
measurement-wise occlusion, a previously unstudied approach, all objects may
generate measurements but some measurements may be occluded by others. While
the relative validity of each abstraction depends on the situation and sensor,
measurement-wise occlusion fits into probabilistic multi-object tracking
algorithms with much looser assumptions on object interaction. Its value is
demonstrated by showing that it naturally derives a popular approximation for
lidar tracking, and by an example of visual tracking in image space.

"An infinite family of prime knots with a certain property for the clasp
  number","  The clasp number $c(K)$ of a knot $K$ is the minimum number of clasp
singularities among all clasp disks bounded by $K$. It is known that the genus
$g(K)$ and the unknotting number $u(K)$ are lower bounds of the clasp number,
that is, $\max\{g(K),u(K)\} \leq c(K)$. Then it is natural to ask whether there
exists a knot $K$ such that $\max\{g(K),u(K)\}<c(K)$. In this paper, we prove
that there exists an infinite family of prime knots such that the question
above is affirmative.

"A Low-Delay Low-Complexity EKF Design for Joint Channel and CFO
  Estimation in Multi-User Cognitive Communications","  Parameter estimation in cognitive communications can be formulated as a
multi-user estimation problem, which is solvable under maximum likelihood
solution but involves high computational complexity. This paper presents a
time-sharing and interference mitigation based EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)
design for joint CFO (carrier frequency offset) and channel estimation at
multiple cognitive users. The key objective is to realize low implementation
complexity by decomposing highdimensional parameters into multiple separate
low-dimensional estimation problems, which can be solved in a time-shared
manner via pipelining operation. We first present a basic EKF design that
estimates the parameters from one TX user to one RX antenna. Then such basic
design is time-shared and reused to estimate parameters from multiple TX users
to multiple RX antennas. Meanwhile, we use interference mitigation module to
cancel the co-channel interference at each RX sample. In addition, we further
propose adaptive noise variance tracking module to improve the estimation
performance. The proposed design enjoys low delay and low buffer size (because
of its online real-time processing), as well as low implementation complexity
(because of time-sharing and pipeling design). Its estimation performance is
verified to be close to Cramer-Rao bound.

A Parametric Simplex Algorithm for Linear Vector Optimization Problems,"  In this paper, a parametric simplex algorithm for solving linear vector
optimization problems (LVOPs) is presented. This algorithm can be seen as a
variant of the multi-objective simplex (Evans-Steuer) algorithm [12]. Different
from it, the proposed algorithm works in the parameter space and does not aim
to find the set of all efficient solutions. Instead, it finds a solution in the
sense of Loehne [16], that is, it finds a subset of efficient solutions that
allows to generate the whole frontier. In that sense, it can also be seen as a
generalization of the parametric self-dual simplex algorithm, which originally
is designed for solving single objective linear optimization problems, and is
modified to solve two objective bounded LVOPs with the positive orthant as the
ordering cone in Ruszczynski and Vanderbei [21]. The algorithm proposed here
works for any dimension, any solid pointed polyhedral ordering cone C and for
bounded as well as unbounded problems. Numerical results are provided to
compare the proposed algorithm with an objective space based LVOP algorithm
(Benson algorithm in [13]), that also provides a solution in the sense of [16],
and with Evans-Steuer algorithm [12]. The results show that for non-degenerate
problems the proposed algorithm outperforms Benson algorithm and is on par with
Evan-Steuer algorithm. For highly degenerate problems Benson's algorithm [13]
excels the simplex-type algorithms; however, the parametric simplex algorithm
is for these problems computationally much more efficient than Evans-Steuer
algorithm.

Nonlinear Dynamics in a Magnetic Josephson Junction,"  We theoretically consider a Josephson junction formed by a ferromagnetic
spacer with a strong spin-orbit interaction or a magnetic spin valve, i.e., a
bilayer with one static and one free layer. Electron spin transport facilitates
a nonlinear dynamical coupling between the magnetic moment and charge current,
which consists of normal and superfluid components. By phenomenologically
adding reactive and dissipative interactions (guided by structural and Onsager
symmetries), we construct magnetic torques and charge pumping, whose
microscopic origins are also discussed. A stability analysis of our coupled
nonlinear systems generates a rich phase diagram with fixed points, limit
cycles, and quasiperiodic states. Our findings reduce to the known phase
diagrams for current-biased nonmagnetic Josephson junctions, on the one hand,
and spin-torque driven magnetic films, on the other, in the absence of coupling
between the magnetic and superconducting order parameters.

"First limits on the very-high energy gamma-ray afterglow emission of a
  fast radio burst: H.E.S.S. observations of FRB 150418","  Aims: Following the detection of the fast radio burst FRB150418 by the SUPERB
project at the Parkes radio telescope, we aim to search for very-high energy
gamma-ray afterglow emission. Methods: Follow-up observations in the very-high
energy gamma-ray domain were obtained with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope system within 14.5 hours of the radio burst. Results: The
obtained 1.4 hours of gamma-ray observations are presented and discussed. At
the 99 % C.L. we obtained an integral upper limit on the gamma-ray flux of
(E>350 GeV) < 1.33 x 10^-8 m^-2s^-1. Differential flux upper limits as function
of the photon energy were derived and used to constrain the intrinsic
high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418. Conclusions: No hints for
high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418 were found. Taking absorption on
the extragalactic background light into account and assuming a distance of z =
0.492 based on radio and optical counterpart studies and consistent with the
FRB dispersion, we constrain the gamma-ray luminosity at 1 TeV to L < 5.1 x
10^47 erg/s at 99% C.L.

"ALMA detection of a tentative nearly edge-on rotating disk around the
  nearby AGB star R~Doradus","  A spectral scan of the circumstellar environment of the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star R~Doradus was taken with ALMA in cycle 2 at frequencies
between 335 and 362 GHz and with a spatial resolution of $\sim$150
milliarcseconds. Many molecular lines show a spatial offset between the blue
and red shifted emission in the innermost regions of the wind. The
position-velocity diagrams of this feature, in combination with previous SPHERE
data and theoretical work point towards the presence of a compact
differentially rotating disk, orientated nearly edge-on. We model the $^{\rm
28}$SiO ($v=1,~J=8\to7$) emission with a disk model. We estimate the disk mass
and angular momentum to be $3 \times 10^{-6}$ Solar masses and $5 \times
10^{40}\ {\rm m^2 kg/s}$. The latter presents an `angular momentum problem'
that may be solved by assuming that the disk is the result of wind-companion
interactions with a companion of at least 2.5 earth masses, located at 6 AU,
the tentatively determined location of the disk's inner rim. An isolated clump
of emission is detected to the south-east with a velocity that is high compared
to the previously determined terminal velocity of the wind. Its position and
mean velocity suggest that it may be associated with a companion planet,
located at the disk's inner rim.

Estimating the Prevalence of Deception in Online Review Communities,"  Consumers' purchase decisions are increasingly influenced by user-generated
online reviews. Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential
for posting ""deceptive opinion spam"" -- fictitious reviews that have been
deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while this
practice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively
little is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online
review communities, and less still about the factors that influence it.
  We propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with a
deception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six
popular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline,
TripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of online
reviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminish
the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting
as a signal to a product's true, unknown quality. We find that deceptive
opinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth rates
across communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the different
signaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g.,
posting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,
filtering reviews written by first-time reviewers, deception prevalence is
effectively reduced.

"Critical Temperature Enhancement of Topological Superconductors: A
  Dynamical Mean Field Study","  We show that a critical temperature Tc for spin-singlet two-dimensional
superconductivity is enhanced by a cooperation between the Zeeman magnetic
field and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where a superconductivity becomes
topologically non-trivial below Tc. The dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) with
the segment-based hybridization-expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
impurity solver (ct-HYB) is used for accurately evaluating a critical
temperature, without any Fermion sign problem. A strong-coupling approach shows
that spin-flip driven local pair hopping leads to part of this enhancement,
especially effects of the magnetic field. We propose physical settings suitable
for verifying the present calculations, one-atom-layer system on Si(111) and
ionic-liquid based electric double-layer transistors (EDLTs).

"Solar cycle full-shape predictions: a global error evaluation for cycle
  24","  There are many proposed prediction methods for solar cycles behavior. In a
previous paper we updated the full-shape curve prediction of the current solar
cycle 24 using a non-linear dynamics method and we compared the results with
the predictions collected by the NOAA/SEC prediction panel, using observed data
up to October 2010. The aim of the present paper is to give a quantitative
evaluation, a posteriori, of the performances of these prediction methods using
a specific global error, updated on a monthly basis, which is a measure of the
global performance on the predicted shape (both amplitude and phase) of the
solar cycle. We suggest also the use of a percent cycle similarity degree, to
better evaluate the predicted shape of the solar cycle curve.

corresponding examples in the divergence case are also discussed. One
implication of these examples is that the ranges of $p$ are sharp in the recent
results obtained in [4,5] for non-divergence type elliptic and parabolic
equations in a half space with the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition when
the coefficients do not have any regularity in a tangential direction.

On interrelations between divergence-free and Hamiltonian dynamics,"  A mathematically correct description is presented on the interrelations
between the dynamics of divergence free vector fields on an oriented
3-dimensional manifold $M$ and the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. It is shown
that for a given divergence free vector field $X$ with a global cross-section
there exist some 4-dimensional symplectic manifold $\tilde{M}\supset M$ and a
smooth Hamilton function $H: \tilde{M}\to \mathbb R$ such that for some $c\in
\mathbb R$ one gets $M = \{H=c\}$ and the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$
restricted on this level coincides with $X$. For divergence free vector fields
with singular points such the extension is impossible but the existence of
local cross-section allows one to reduce the dynamics to the study of
symplectic diffeomorphisms in some sub-domains of $M$. We also consider the
case of a divergence free vector field $X$ with a smooth integral having only
finite number of critical levels. It is shown that such a noncritical level is
always a 2-torus and restriction of $X$ on it possesses a smooth invariant
2-form. The linearization of the flow on such a torus (i.e. the reduction to
the constant vector field) is not always possible in contrast to the case of an
integrable Hamiltonian system but in the analytic case ($M$ and $X$ are real
analytic), due to the Kolmogorov theorem, such the linearization is possible
for tori with Diophantine rotation numbers.

"Beamspace Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems via Cosparse Image
  Reconstruction Technique","  This paper considers the beamspace channel estimation problem in 3D lens
antenna array under a millimeter-wave communication system. We analyze the
focusing capability of the 3D lens antenna array and the sparsity of the
beamspace channel response matrix. Considering the analysis, we observe that
the channel matrix can be treated as a 2D natural image; that is, the channel
is sparse, and the changes between adjacent elements are subtle. Thus, for the
channel estimation, we incorporate an image reconstruction technique called
sparse non-informative parameter estimator-based cosparse analysis AMP for
imaging (SCAMPI) algorithm. The SCAMPI algorithm is faster and more accurate
than earlier algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit and support
detection algorithms. To further improve the SCAMPI algorithm, we model the
channel distribution as a generic Gaussian mixture (GM) probability and embed
the expectation maximization learning algorithm into the SCAMPI algorithm to
learn the parameters in the GM probability. We show that the GM probability
outperforms the common uniform distribution used in image reconstruction. We
also propose a phase-shifter-reduced selection network structure to decrease
the power consumption of the system and prove that the SCAMPI algorithm is
robust even if the number of phase shifters is reduced by 10%.

"Texture zeroes and discrete flavor symmetries in light and heavy
  Majorana neutrino mass matrices: a bottom-up approach","  Texture zeroes in neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ may give us hints about the
symmetries involved in neutrino mass generation. We examine the viability of
such texture zeroes in a model independent way through a bottom-up approach.
Using constraints from the neutrino oscillation data, we develop an analytic
framework that can identify these symmetries and quantify deviations from them.
We analyze the textures of $M_\nu$ as well as those of $M_M$, the mass matrix
of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the context of Type-I seesaw. We point out how
the viability of textures depends on the absolute neutrino mass scale, the
neutrino mass ordering and the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. We also examine the
compatibility of discrete flavor symmetries like $\mu$--$\tau$ exchange and
$S_3$ permutation with the current data. We show that the $\mu-\tau$ exchange
symmetry for $M_\nu$ can be satisfied for any value of the absolute neutrino
mass, but for $M_\nu$ to satisfy the $S_3$ symmetry, neutrino masses have to be
quasi-degenerate. On the other hand, both these symmetries are currently
allowed for $M_M$ for all values of absolute neutrino mass and both mass
orderings.

Performance verification of the CMS Phase-1 Upgrade Pixel detector,"  The CMS tracker consists of two tracking systems utilizing semiconductor
technology: the inner pixel and the outer strip detectors. The tracker
detectors occupy the volume around the beam interaction region between 3 cm and
110 cm in radius and up to 280 cm along the beam axis. The pixel detector
consists of 124 million pixels, corresponding to about 2 m$^{2}$ total area. It
plays a vital role in the seeding of the track reconstruction algorithms and in
the reconstruction of primary interactions and secondary decay vertices. It is
surrounded by the strip tracker with 10 million read-out channels,
corresponding to 200 m$^{2}$ total area. The tracker is operated in a
high-occupancy and high-radiation environment established by particle
collisions in the LHC. The performance of the silicon strip detector continues
to be of high quality. The pixel detector that has been used in Run 1 and in
the first half of Run 2 was, however, replaced with the so-called Phase-1
Upgrade detector. The new system is better suited to match the increased
instantaneous luminosity the LHC would reach before 2023. It was built to
operate at an instantaneous luminosity of around
2$\times$10$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The detector's new layout has an
additional inner layer with respect to the previous one; it allows for more
efficient tracking with smaller fake rate at higher event pile-up. The paper
focuses on the first results obtained during the commissioning of the new
detector. It also includes challenges faced during the first data taking to
reach the optimal measurement efficiency. Details will be given on the
performance at high occupancy with respect to observables such as data-rate,
hit reconstruction efficiency, and resolution.

Deciphering mRNA Sequence Determinants of Protein Production Rate,"  One of the greatest challenges in biophysical models of translation is to
identify coding sequences features that affect the rate of translation and
therefore the overall protein production in the cell. We propose an analytic
method to solve a translation model based on the inhomogeneous totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process, which allows us to unveil simple design
principles of nucleotide sequences determining protein production rates. Our
solution shows an excellent agreement when compared to numerical genome-wide
simulations of S. cerevisiae transcript sequences and predicts that the first
10 codons, together with the value of the initiation rate, are the main
determinants of protein production rate. Finally, we interpret the obtained
analytic results based on the evolutionary role of codons' choice for
regulating translation rates and ribosome densities.

Astrometric orbit of a low-mass companion to an ultracool dwarf,"  Little is known about the existence of extrasolar planets around ultracool
dwarfs. Furthermore, binary stars with Sun-like primaries and very low-mass
binaries composed of ultracool dwarfs show differences in the distributions of
mass ratio and orbital separation that can be indicative of distinct formation
mechanisms. Using FORS2/VLT optical imaging for high precision astrometry we
are searching for planets and substellar objects around ultracool dwarfs to
investigate their multiplicity properties for very low companion masses. Here
we report astrometric measurements with an accuracy of two tenths of a
milli-arcsecond over two years that reveal orbital motion of the nearby L1.5
dwarf DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 located at 20.77 +/- 0.08 pc caused by an unseen
companion that revolves about its host on an eccentric orbit in 246.4 +/- 1.4
days. We estimate the L1.5 dwarf to have 7.5 +/- 0.7 % of the Sun's mass that
implies a companion mass of 28 +/- 2 Jupiter masses. This new system has the
smallest mass ratio (0.36 +/- 0.02) of known very low-mass binaries with
characterised orbits. With this discovery we demonstrate 200 micro-arcsecond
astrometry over an arc-minute field and over several years that is sufficient
to discover sub-Jupiter mass planets around ultracool dwarfs. We also show that
the achieved parallax accuracy of < 0.4 % makes it possible to remove distance
as a dominant source of uncertainty in the modelling of ultracool dwarfs.

Parallel Working-Set Search Structures,"  In this paper we present two versions of a parallel working-set map on p
processors that supports searches, insertions and deletions. In both versions,
the total work of all operations when the map has size at least p is bounded by
the working-set bound, i.e., the cost of an item depends on how recently it was
accessed (for some linearization): accessing an item in the map with recency r
takes O(1+log r) work. In the simpler version each map operation has O((log
p)^2+log n) span (where n is the maximum size of the map). In the pipelined
version each map operation on an item with recency r has O((log p)^2+log r)
span. (Operations in parallel may have overlapping span; span is additive only
for operations in sequence.)
  Both data structures are designed to be used by a dynamic multithreading
parallel program that at each step executes a unit-time instruction or makes a
data structure call. To achieve the stated bounds, the pipelined data structure
requires a weak-priority scheduler, which supports a limited form of 2-level
prioritization. At the end we explain how the results translate to practical
implementations using work-stealing schedulers.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parallel implementation of a
self-adjusting search structure where the cost of an operation adapts to the
access sequence. A corollary of the working-set bound is that it achieves work
static optimality: the total work is bounded by the access costs in an optimal
static search tree.

New Candidate Eruptive Young Stars in Lynds 1340,"  We report on the discovery of three candidate eruptive young stars, found
during our comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the young stellar population
of the dark cloud L1340. These stars are as follows. (1) IRAS 02224+7227 (2MASS
02270555+7241167, HH 487 S) exhibited FUor-like spectrum in our low-resolution
optical spectra. The available photometric data restrict its luminosity to 23
L_sun < L_bol < 59 L_sun. (2) 2MASS 02263797+7304575, identified as a classical
T Tauri star during our H alpha survey, exhibited an EXor type brightening in
2005 November, at the time of the SDSS observations of the region. (3) 2MASS
02325605+7246055, a low-mass embedded young star, associated with a fan-shaped
infrared nebula, underwent an outburst between the DSS1 and DSS2 surveys,
leading to the appearance of a faint optical nebula. Our [SII] and H alpha
images, as well as the Spitzer IRAC 4.5 micron images revealed Herbig-Haro
objects associated with this star. Our results suggest that amplitudes and time
scales of outbursts do not necessarily correlate with the evolutionary stage of
the stars.

On two conjectures of Maurer concerning basis graphs of matroids,"  We characterize 2-dimensional complexes associated canonically with basis
graphs of matroids as simply connected triangle-square complexes satisfying
some local conditions. This proves a version of a (disproved) conjecture by
Stephen Maurer (Conjecture 3 of S. Maurer, Matroid basis graphs I, JCTB 14
(1973), 216-240). We also establish Conjecture 1 from the same paper about the
redundancy of the conditions in the characterization of basis graphs. We
indicate positive-curvature-like aspects of the local properties of the studied
complexes. We characterize similarly the corresponding 2-dimensional complexes
of even $\Delta$-matroids.

Angular momentum evolution for galaxies in a Lambda-CDM scenario,"  Galaxy formation in the current cosmological paradigm is a very complex
process in which inflows, outflows, interactions and mergers are common events.
These processes can redistribute the angular momentum content of baryons.
Recent observational results suggest that disc formed conserving angular
momentum while elliptical galaxies, albeit losing angular momentum, determine a
correlation between the specific angular momentum of the galaxy and the stellar
mass. These observations provide stringent constraints for galaxy formation
models in a hierarchical clustering scenario. We aim to analyse the specific
angular momentum content of the disc and bulge components as a function of
virial mass, stellar mass and redshift. We also estimate the size of the
simulated galaxies and confront them with observations. We use cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations that include an effective, physically-motivated
Supernova feedback which is able to regulate the star formation in haloes of
different masses. We analyse the morphology and formation history of a sample
of galaxies in a cosmological simulation by performing a bulge-disc
decomposition of the analysed systems and their progenitors. We estimate the
angular momentum content of the stellar and gaseous discs, stellar bulges and
total baryons. In agreement with recent observational findings, our simulated
galaxies have disc and spheroid components whose specific angular momentum
contents determine correlations with the stellar and dark matter masses with
the same slope, although the spheroidal components are off-set by a fixed
fraction. Abridged.

New parameterized algorithms for edge dominating set,"  An edge dominating set of a graph G=(V,E) is a subset M of edges in the graph
such that each edge in E-M is incident with at least one edge in M. In an
instance of the parameterized edge dominating set problem we are given a graph
G=(V,E) and an integer k and we are asked to decide whether G has an edge
dominating set of size at most k. In this paper we show that the parameterized
edge dominating set problem can be solved in O^*(2.3147^k) time and polynomial
space. We show that this problem can be reduced to a quadratic kernel with
O(k^3) edges.

  quantum wells","  Experimental and theoretical studies of all-optical spin pump and probe of
resident electrons in CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te semiconductor quantum wells are reported.
A two-color Hanle-MOKE technique (based on continuous-wave excitation) and
time-resolved Kerr rotation in the regime of resonant spin amplification (based
on pulsed excitation) provide a complementary measure of electron spin
relaxation time. Influence of electron localization on long-lived spin
coherence is examined by means of spectral and temperature dependencies.
Various scenarios of spin polarization generation (via the trion and exciton
states) are analyzed and difference between continuous-wave and pulsed
excitations is considered. Effects related to inhomogeneous distribution of
$g$-factor and anisotropic spin relaxation time on measured quantities are
discussed.

"Kelvin--Helmholtz instability in a cool solar jet in the framework of
  Hall magnetohydrodynamics: A case study","  We investigate the conditions under which the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes
in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube moving along its axis become unstable
against the Kelvin--Helmholtz (KH) instability. We \textbf{use} the dispersion
relations of MHD modes \textbf{obtained} from the linearized Hall MHD equations
for cool (zero beta) plasma \textbf{by assuming} real wave numbers and complex
angular wave frequencies\textbf{/complex wave phase velocities}. The dispersion
equations are solved numerically at fixed input parameters and varying values
of the ratio $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, where $l_\mathrm{Hall} =
c/\omega_\mathrm{pi}$ ($c$ being the speed of light, and $\omega_\mathrm{pi}$
the ion plasma frequency) and $a$ is the flux tube radius. It is shown that the
stability of the MHD modes depends upon four parameters: the density contrast
between the flux tube and its environment, the ratio of external and internal
magnetic fields, the ratio $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, and the value of the Alfv\'en
Mach number \textbf{defined as the ratio of the tube axial velocity to Alfv\'en
speed inside the flux tube}. It is found that at high density contrasts, for
small values of $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, the kink ($m = 1$) mode can become
unstable against KH instability at some critical Alfv\'en Mach number (or
equivalently at critical flow speed), but a threshold $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$ can
suppress the onset of the KH instability. At small density contrasts, however,
the magnitude of $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$ does not affect noticeably the condition
for instability occurrence---even though it can reduce the critical Alfv\'en
Mach number. It is established that the sausage mode ($m = 0$) is not subject
to the KH instability.

Conduction through 71o domain walls in BiFeO3 thin films,"  Local conduction at domains and domains walls is investigated in BiFeO3 thin
films containing mostly 71o domain walls. Measurements at room temperature
reveal conduction through 71o domain walls. Conduction through domains could
also be observed at high enough temperatures. It is found that, despite the
lower conductivity of the domains, both are governed by the same mechanisms: in
the low voltage regime electrons trapped at defect states are
temperature-activated but the current is limited by the ferroelectric surface
charges; in the large voltage regime, Schottky emission takes place and the
role of oxygen vacancies is that of selectively increasing the Fermi energy at
the walls and locally reducing the Schottky barrier. This understanding
provides the key to engineering conduction paths in oxides.

"A general method to construct cube-like categories and applications to
  homotopy theory","  In this paper, we introduce a method to construct new categories which look
like ""cubes"", and discuss model structures on the presheaf categories over
them. First, we introduce a notion of thin-powered structure on small
categories, which provides a generalized notion of ""power-sets"" on categories.
Next, we see that if a small category $\mathcal{R}$ admits a good thin-powered
structure, we can construct a new category $\square(\mathcal{R})$ called the
cubicalization of the category. We also see that $\square(\mathcal{R})$ is
equipped with enough structures so that many arguments made for the classical
cube category $\square$ are also available. In particular, it is a test
category in the sense of Grothendieck. The resulting categories contain the
cube category $\square$, the cube category with connections $\square^c$, the
extended cubical category $\square_\Sigma$ introduced by Isaacson, and cube
categories $\square_G$ symmetrized by more general group operads $G$. We
finally discuss model structures on the presheaf categories
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ over cubicalizations. We prove that
$\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge$ admits a model structure such that the simplicial
realization $\square(\mathcal{R})^\wedge\to SSet$ is a left Quillen functor.
Moreover, in the case of $\square_G$ for group operads $G$, $\square^\wedge_G$
is a monoidal model category, and we have a sequence of monoidal Quillen
equivalences $\square Set \to \square_G^\wedge\to SSet$. For example, if $G=B$
is the group operad consisting of braid groups, the category $\square^\wedge_B$
is a braided monoidal model category whose homotopy category is equivalent to
that of $SSet$.

genomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese
population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic
panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental
population structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties
suitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric
traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will
be feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of
these Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of
geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little
significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population
since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that
the Southern Japanese Medaka existed as a larger older population which went
through a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we
detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population.
Conclusions These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu Medaka
samples are suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel
and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.

On the expressive power of read-once determinants,"  We introduce and study the notion of read-$k$ projections of the determinant:
a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is called a {\it read-$k$
projection of determinant} if $f=det(M)$, where entries of matrix $M$ are
either field elements or variables such that each variable appears at most $k$
times in $M$. A monomial set $S$ is said to be expressible as read-$k$
projection of determinant if there is a read-$k$ projection of determinant $f$
such that the monomial set of $f$ is equal to $S$. We obtain basic results
relating read-$k$ determinantal projections to the well-studied notion of
determinantal complexity. We show that for sufficiently large $n$, the $n
\times n$ permanent polynomial $Perm_n$ and the elementary symmetric
polynomials of degree $d$ on $n$ variables $S_n^d$ for $2 \leq d \leq n-2$ are
not expressible as read-once projection of determinant, whereas $mon(Perm_n)$
and $mon(S_n^d)$ are expressible as read-once projections of determinant. We
also give examples of monomial sets which are not expressible as read-once
projections of determinant.

"Decoupling Jupiter's deep and atmospheric flows using the upcoming Juno
  gravity measurements and a dynamical inverse model","  Observations of the flow on Jupiter exists essentially only for the
cloud-level, which is dominated by strong east-west jet-streams. These have
been suggested to result from dynamics in a superficial thin weather-layer, or
alternatively be a manifestation of deep interior cylindrical flows. However,
it is possible that the observed winds are indeed superficial, yet there exists
deep flow that is completely decoupled from it. To date, all models linking the
wind, via the induced density anomalies, to the gravity field, to be measured
by Juno, consider only flow that is a projection of the observed could-level
wind. Here we explore the possibility of complex wind dynamics that include
both the shallow weather-layer wind, and a deep flow that is decoupled from the
flow above it. The upper flow is based on the observed cloud-level flow and is
set to decay with depth. The deep flow is constructed to produce cylindrical
structures with variable width and magnitude, thus allowing for a wide range of
possible scenarios for the unknown deep flow. The combined flow is then related
to the density anomalies and gravitational moments via a dynamical model. An
adjoint inverse model is used for optimizing the parameters controlling the
setup of the deep and surface-bound flows, so that these flows can be
reconstructed given a gravity field. We show that the model can be used for
examination of various scenarios, including cases in which the deep flow is
dominating over the surface wind. We discuss extensively the uncertainties
associated with the model solution. The flexibility of the adjoint method
allows for a wide range of dynamical setups, so that when new observations and
physical understanding will arise, these constraints could be easily
implemented and used to better decipher Jupiter flow dynamics.

"Relativistic Resonant Relations between Massive Black Hole Binary and
  Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral","  One component of a massive black hole binary (MBHB) might capture a small
third body, and then a hierarchical, inclined triple system would be formed.
With the post-Newtonian approximation including radiation reaction, we analyzed
the evolution of the triple initially with small eccentricities. We found that
an essentially new resonant relation could arise in the triple system. Here
relativistic effects are crucial. Relativistic resonances, including the new
one, stably work even for an outer MBHB of comparable masses, and significantly
change the orbit of the inner small body.

IRAS 20050+2720: Anatomy of a young stellar cluster,"  IRAS 20050+2720 is young star forming region at a distance of 700 pc without
apparent high mass stars. We present results of our multiwavelength study of
IRAS 20050+2720 which includes observations by Chandra and Spitzer, and 2MASS
and UBVRI photometry. In total, about 300 YSOs in different evolutionary stages
are found. We characterize the distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) in
this region using a minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis. We newly identify a
second cluster core, which consists mostly of class II objects, about 10 arcmin
from the center of the cloud. YSOs of earlier evolutionary stages are more
clustered than more evolved objects. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of
IRAS 20050+2720 is roughly lognormal, but steeper than the XLF of the more
massive Orion nebula complex. IRAS 20050+2720 shows a lower N_H/A_K ratio
compared with the diffuse ISM.

manuscript is two-fold. First we prove a GNS inequality for convex domains,
with explicit constants which depend on the geometry of the domain. Later,
using the discrete version of Rumin's method, we prove GNS inequalities on
cubes with improved constants.

"Separating timing, movement conditions and individual differences in the
  analysis of human movement","  A central task in the analysis of human movement behavior is to determine
systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions,
participants and repetitions. This is possible because human movement is highly
regular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and
movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating
variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a
well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms
of preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear
mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain
systematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path
relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which
the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation
found in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm
movements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location
while avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data
according to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes
nonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis
frameworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that
estimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the
task demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions
of movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle
placement and height on the movement path. We demonstrate that the approach can
be used to uncover new properties of human movement.

"Efficient coupling between dielectric waveguide modes and exterior
  plasmon whispering gallery modes","  Inefficient coupling between dielectric guided mode and plasmon mode has been
overlooked in the past. The mechanism in it is essentially different from the
conventional coupling between dielectric modes. Based on qualitative
theoretical analysis, we proposed two methods to strengthen the coupling
between dielectric waveguide modes and exterior plasmon whispering gallery
modes. One is using a U-shaped bent waveguide to break the adiabatic mode
conversion process, and the other is to render the dielectric mode of
higher-order to reach phase matching with plasmon mode. Both the transmission
spectrum of waveguide and the energy spectrum of cavity demonstrate that the
coupling efficiencies can be greatly improved. These simple configurations are
potential for wide applications, for example, tunable integrated optical
devices, nanolasers and sensors.

"Asymptotic behaviors of representations of graded categories with
  inductive functors","  In this paper we describe an inductive machinery to investigate asymptotic
behaviors of homology groups and related invariants of representations of
certain graded combinatorial categories over a commutative Noetherian ring $k$,
via introducing inductive functors which generalize important properties of
shift functors of $\mathrm{FI}$-modules. In particular, a sufficient criterion
for finiteness of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of finitely generated
representations of these categories is obtained. As applications, we show that
a few important infinite combinatorial categories appearing in representation
stability theory are equipped with inductive functors, and hence the finiteness
of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of their finitely generated representations
is guaranteed. We also prove that truncated representations of these categories
have linear minimal resolutions by relative projective modules, which are
precisely linear minimal projective resolutions when $k$ is a field of
characteristic 0.

Underdamped stochastic harmonic oscillator,"  We investigate stationary states of the linear damped stochastic oscillator
driven by L\'evy noises. In the long time limit kinetic and potential energies
of the oscillator do not fulfill the equipartition theorem and their
distributions follow the power-law asymptotics. At the same time, partition of
the mechanical energy is controlled by the damping coefficient. We show that in
the limit of vanishing damping a stochastic analogue of the equipartition
theorem can be proposed, namely the statistical properties of potential and
kinetic energies attain distributions characterized by the same width. Finally,
we demonstrate that the ratio of instantaneous kinetic and potential energies
which signifies departure from the mechanical energy equipartition, follows
universal power-law asymptotics.

Big Data Analytics and Its Applications,"  The term, Big Data, has been authored to refer to the extensive heave of data
that can't be managed by traditional data handling methods or techniques. The
field of Big Data plays an indispensable role in various fields, such as
agriculture, banking, data mining, education, chemistry, finance, cloud
computing, marketing, health care stocks. Big data analytics is the method for
looking at big data to reveal hidden patterns, incomprehensible relationship
and other important data that can be utilize to resolve on enhanced decisions.
There has been a perpetually expanding interest for big data because of its
fast development and since it covers different areas of applications. Apache
Hadoop open source technology created in Java and keeps running on Linux
working framework was used. The primary commitment of this exploration is to
display an effective and free solution for big data application in a
distributed environment, with its advantages and indicating its easy use. Later
on, there emerge to be a required for an analytical review of new developments
in the big data technology. Healthcare is one of the best concerns of the
world. Big data in healthcare imply to electronic health data sets that are
identified with patient healthcare and prosperity. Data in the healthcare area
is developing past managing limit of the healthcare associations and is relied
upon to increment fundamentally in the coming years.

"SKIRT: an Advanced Dust Radiative Transfer Code with a User-Friendly
  Architecture","  We discuss the architecture and design principles that underpin the latest
version of SKIRT, a state-of-the-art open source code for simulating continuum
radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems, such as spiral galaxies and
accretion disks. SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the
relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by
the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries, radiation source
spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to
various mechanisms for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical
simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined at
run-time through a user-friendly interface suitable for both occasional and
power users. These capabilities are enabled by careful C++ code design. The
programming interfaces between components are well defined and narrow. Adding a
new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface
automatically adjusts to allow configuring the new options. We argue that many
scientific codes, like SKIRT, can benefit from careful object-oriented design
and from a friendly user interface, even if it is not a graphical user
interface.

"Crucible aperture: an effective way to reduce source oxidation in oxide
  molecular beam epitaxy process","  Growing multi-elemental complex-oxide structures using an MBE (Molecular Beam
Epitaxy) technique requires precise control of each source flux. However, when
the component elements have significantly different oxygen affinities,
maintaining stable fluxes for easily oxidizing elements is challenging because
of a source oxidation problem. Here, using Sr as a test source, we show that a
crucible aperture insert scheme significantly reduces the source oxidation in
an oxide-MBE environment. The crucible aperture insert was shaped like a disk
with a hole at the center and was mounted inside the crucible; it blocks most
of the oxygen species coming to the source, thus reducing the source oxidation.
However, the depth of the aperture disk was critical for its performance; an
ill-positioned aperture could make the flux stability even worse. With an
optimally positioned aperture insert, the crucible exhibited more than four
times improvement in Sr flux stability, compared to a conventional,
non-apertured crucible.

Testing the characteristics of a L\'evy process,"  For $n$ equidistant observations of a L\'evy process at time distance
$\Delta_n$ we consider the problem of testing hypotheses on the volatility, the
jump measure and its Blumenthal-Getoor index in a non- or semiparametric
manner. Asymptotically as $n\to\infty$ we allow for both, the high-frequency
regime $\Delta_n=\frac1n$ and the low-frequency regime $\Delta_n=1$ as well as
intermediate cases. The approach via empirical characteristic function unifies
existing theory and sheds new light on diverse results. Particular emphasis is
given to asymptotic separation rates which reveal the complexity of these
basic, but surprisingly non-standard inference questions.

"Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg interferometry in pair production from
  counterpropagating lasers","  The rate of electron-positron pair production in linearly polarized
counter-propagating lasers is evaluated from a recently discovered solution of
the time-dependent Dirac equation. The latter is solved in momentum space where
it is formally equivalent to the Schr\""odinger equation describing a strongly
driven two-level system. The solution is found from a simple transformation of
the Dirac equation and is given in compact form in terms of the
doubly-confluent Heun's function. By using the analogy with the two-level
system, it is shown that for high-intensity lasers, pair production occurs
through periodic non-adiabatic transitions when the adiabatic energy gap is
minimal. These transitions give rise to an intricate interference pattern in
the pair spectrum, reminiscent of the Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg phenomenon in
molecular physics: the accumulated phase result in constructive or destructive
interference. The adiabatic-impulse model is used to study this phenomenon and
shows an excellent agreement with the exact result.

"Characterization of Infrared Dark Clouds -- NH$_3$ Observations of an
  Absorption-contrast Selected IRDC Sample","  Despite increasing research in massive star formation, little is known about
its earliest stages. Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense and massive
enough to harbour the sites of future high-mass star formation. But up to now,
mainly small samples have been observed and analysed. To understand the
physical conditions during the early stages of high-mass star formation, it is
necessary to learn more about the physical conditions and stability in
relatively unevolved IRDCs. Thus, for characterising IRDCs studies of large
samples are needed. We investigate a complete sample of 218 northern hemisphere
high-contrast IRDCs using the ammonia (1,1)- and (2,2)-inversion transitions.
We detected ammonia (1,1)-inversion transition lines in 109 of our IRDC
candidates. Using the data we were able to study the physical conditions within
the star-forming regions statistically. We compared them with the conditions in
more evolved regions which have been observed in the same fashion as our sample
sources. Our results show that IRDCs have, on average, rotation temperatures of
15 K, are turbulent (with line width FWHMs around 2 km s$^{-1}$), have ammonia
column densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and molecular hydrogen
column densities on the order of $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Their virial masses are
between 100 and a few 1000 M$_\odot$. The comparison of bulk kinetic and
potential energies indicate that the sources are close to virial equilibrium.
IRDCs are on average cooler and less turbulent than a comparison sample of
high-mass protostellar objects, and have lower ammonia column densities. Virial
parameters indicate that the majority of IRDCs are currently stable, but are
expected to collapse in the future.

"Stellar laboratories. VI. New Mo IV - VII oscillator strengths and the
  molybdenum abundance in the hot white dwarfs G191-B2B and RE0503-289","  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N)
spectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the
reliability of the atomic data that is used for their calculation.
  To identify molybdenum lines in the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the DA-type
white dwarf G191-B2B and the DO-type white dwarf RE0503-289 and to determine
their photospheric Mo abundances, newly calculated Mo IV - VII oscillator
strengths are used.
  We identified twelve Mo V and nine Mo VI lines in the UV spectrum of
RE0503-289 and measured a photospheric Mo abundance of 1.2 - 3.0 x 10**-4 (mass
fraction, 22500 - 56400 times the solar abundance). In addition, from the As V
and Sn IV resonance lines, we measured mass fractions of arsenic (0.5 - 1.3 x
10**-5, about 300 - 1200 times solar) and tin (1.3 - 3.2 x 10**-4, about 14300
35200 times solar). For G191-B2B, upper limits were determined for the
abundances of Mo (5.3 x 10**-7, 100 times solar) and, in addition, for Kr (1.1
x 10**-6, 10 times solar) and Xe (1.7 x 10**-7, 10 times solar). The arsenic
abundance was determined (2.3 - 5.9 x 10**-7, about 21 - 53 times solar). A
new, registered German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO) service, TOSS,
has been constructed to provide weighted oscillator strengths and transition
probabilities.
  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for
stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Mo V - VI line profiles in the UV
spectrum of the white dwarf RE0503-289 were well reproduced with our newly
calculated oscillator strengths. For the first time, this allowed to determine
the photospheric Mo abundance in a white dwarf.

Cavity-Enhanced Rayleigh Scattering,"  We demonstrate Purcell-like enhancement of Rayleigh scattering into a single
optical mode of a Fabry-Perot resonator for several thermal atomic and
molecular gases. The light is detuned by more than an octave, in this case by
hundreds of nanometers, from any optical transition, making particle excitation
and spontaneous emission negligible. The enhancement of light scattering into
the resonator is explained quantitatively as an interference effect of light
waves emitted by a classical driven dipole oscillator. Applications of our
method include the sensitive, non-destructive in-situ detection of ultracold
molecules.

the first time using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0

centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The decays considered are $B_c^+\to
D^{(*)+}_{(s)} \overline{D}^{(*)0}$ and $B_c^+\to D^{(*)+}_{(s)} D^{(*)0}$,
which are normalised to high-yield $B^+\to D^+_{(s)} \overline{D}^0$ decays. No
evidence for a signal is found and limits are set on twelve $B_c^+$ decay

"Geodesic orbit metrics in compact homogeneous manifolds with equivalent
  isotropy submodules","  A geodesic orbit manifold (GO manifold) is a Riemannian manifold (M,g) with
the property that any geodesic in M is an orbit of a one-parameter subgroup of
a group G of isometries of (M,g). The metric g is then called a G-GO metric in
M. For an arbitrary compact homogeneous manifold M=G/H, we simplify the general
problem of determining the G-GO metrics in M. In particular, if the isotropy
representation of H induces equivalent irreducible submodules in the tangent
space of M, we obtain algebraic conditions, under which, any G-GO metric in M
admits a reduced form. As an application we determine the U(n)-GO metrics in
the complex Stiefel manifolds V_k(C^n).

A Propagation Model for Provenance Views of Public/Private Workflows,"  We study the problem of concealing functionality of a proprietary or private
module when provenance information is shown over repeated executions of a
workflow which contains both `public' and `private' modules. Our approach is to
use `provenance views' to hide carefully chosen subsets of data over all
executions of the workflow to ensure G-privacy: for each private module and
each input x, the module's output f(x) is indistinguishable from G -1 other
possible values given the visible data in the workflow executions. We show that
G-privacy cannot be achieved simply by combining solutions for individual
private modules; data hiding must also be `propagated' through public modules.
We then examine how much additional data must be hidden and when it is safe to
stop propagating data hiding. The answer depends strongly on the workflow
topology as well as the behavior of public modules on the visible data. In
particular, for a class of workflows (which include the common tree and chain
workflows), taking private solutions for each private module, augmented with a
`public closure' that is `upstream-downstream safe', ensures G-privacy. We
define these notions formally and show that the restrictions are necessary. We
also study the related optimization problems of minimizing the amount of hidden
data.

"The abundances of hydrocarbon functional groups in the interstellar
  medium inferred from laboratory spectra of hydrogenated and methylated
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","  Infrared (IR) absorption spectra of individual polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing methyl (-CH3), methylene (>CH2), or diamond-like
*CH groups and IR spectra of mixtures of methylated and hydrogenated PAHs
prepared by gas phase condensation were measured at room temperature (as grains
in pellets) and at low temperature (isolated in Ne matrices). In addition, the
PAH blends were subjected to an in-depth molecular structure analysis by means
of high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry. Supported by calculations at the density functional theory
level, the laboratory results were applied to analyze in detail the aliphatic
absorption complex of the diffuse interstellar medium at 3.4 mu-m and to
determine the abundances of hydrocarbon functional groups. Assuming that the
PAHs are mainly locked in grains, aliphatic CHx groups (x = 1,2,3) would
contribute approximately in equal quantities to the 3.4 mu-m feature (N_{CHx} /
N_{H} approx 10^{-5} - 2 * 10^{-5}). The abundances, however, may be two to
four times lower if a major contribution to the 3.4 mu-m feature comes from
molecules in the gas phase. Aromatic =CH groups seem to be almost absent from
some lines of sight, but can be nearly as abundant as each of the aliphatic
components in other directions (N_{=CH} / N_{H} < 2 * 10^{-5}; upper value for
grains). Due to comparatively low binding energies, astronomical IR emission
sources do not display such heavy excess hydrogenation. At best, especially in
proto-planetary nebulae, >CH2 groups bound to aromatic molecules, i.e., excess
hydrogens on the molecular periphery only, can survive the presence of a nearby
star.

Structure of the nucleon's low-lying excitations,"  A continuum approach to the three valence-quark bound-state problem in
quantum field theory is used to perform a comparative study of the four
lightest $(I=1/2,J^P = 1/2^\pm)$ baryon isospin-doublets in order to elucidate
their structural similarities and differences. Such analyses predict the
presence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)
correlations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,
isovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all
play a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and
pseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame
wave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in
this $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground
state. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:
accurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector
diquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark
cores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the
associated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess
measurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state in each
negative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In
quantum field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity
channels must owe to chiral symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly
dynamical in the light-quark sector. Consequently, experiments that can
validate the contrasts drawn herein between the structure of the four lightest
$(1/2,1/2^\pm)$ doublets will prove valuable in testing links between emergent
mass generation and observable phenomena and, plausibly, thereby revealing
dynamical features of confinement.

Opinion Mining In Hindi Language: A Survey,"  Opinions are very important in the life of human beings. These Opinions
helped the humans to carry out the decisions. As the impact of the Web is
increasing day by day, Web documents can be seen as a new source of opinion for
human beings. Web contains a huge amount of information generated by the users
through blogs, forum entries, and social networking websites and so on To
analyze this large amount of information it is required to develop a method
that automatically classifies the information available on the Web. This domain
is called Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining. Opinion Mining or Sentiment
Analysis is a natural language processing task that mine information from
various text forms such as reviews, news, and blogs and classify them on the
basis of their polarity as positive, negative or neutral. But, from the last
few years, enormous increase has been seen in Hindi language on the Web.
Research in opinion mining mostly carried out in English language but it is
very important to perform the opinion mining in Hindi language also as large
amount of information in Hindi is also available on the Web. This paper gives
an overview of the work that has been done Hindi language.

Rational Normal Scrolls and the Defining Equations of Rees Algebras,"  Consider a height two ideal,
  $I$, which is minimally generated by $m$ homogeneous forms of degree $d$ in
the polynomial ring $R=k[x,y]$. Suppose that one column in the homogeneous
presenting matrix $\f$ of $I$ has entries of degree $n$ and all of the other
entries of $\f$ are linear. We identify an explicit generating set for the
ideal $\Cal A$ which defines the Rees algebra $\Cal R=R[It]$; so $\Cal R=S/\Cal
A$ for the polynomial ring $S=R[T_1,...,T_m]$. We resolve $\Cal R$ as an
$S$-module and $I^s$ as an $R$-module, for all powers $s$. The proof uses the
homogeneous coordinate ring, $A=S/H$, of a rational normal scroll, with
$H\subseteq \Cal A$. The ideal $\Cal AA$ is isomorphic to the $n^{\text{th}}$
symbolic power of a height one prime ideal $K$ of $A$. The ideal $K^{(n)}$ is
generated by monomials. Whenever possible, we study $A/K^{(n)}$ in place of
$A/\Cal AA$ because the generators of $K^{(n)}$ are much less complicated then
the generators of $\Cal AA$. We obtain a filtration of $K^{(n)}$ in which the
factors are polynomial rings, hypersurface rings, or modules resolved by
generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes. The generators of $I$ parameterize an
algebraic curve $\Cal C$ in projective $m-1$ space. The defining equations of
the special fiber ring $\Cal R/(x,y)\Cal R$ yield a solution of the
implicitization problem for $\Cal C$.

Random Matrices and Chaos in Nuclear Physics: Nuclear Reactions,"  The application of random-matrix theory (RMT) to compound-nucleus (CN)
reactions is reviewed. An introduction into the basic concepts of nuclear
scattering theory is followed by a survey of phenomenological approaches to CN
scattering. The implementation of a random-matrix approach into scattering
theory leads to a statistical theory of CN reactions. Since RMT applies
generically to chaotic quantum systems, that theory is, at the same time, a
generic theory of quantum chaotic scattering. It uses a minimum of input
parameters (average S-matrix and mean level spacing of the CN). Predictions of
the theory are derived with the help of field-theoretical methods adapted from
condensed-matter physics and compared with those of phenomenological
approaches. Thorough tests of the theory are reviewed, as are applications in
nuclear physics, with special attention given to violation of symmetries
(isospin, parity) and time-reversal invariance.

Some classes of topological quasi *-algebras,"  The completion $\overline{A}[\tau]$ of a locally convex *-algebra $A [ \tau
]$ with not jointly continuous multiplication is a *-vector space with partial
multiplication $xy$ defined only for $x$ or $y \in A_{0}$, and it is called a
topological quasi *-algebra. In this paper two classes of topological quasi
*-algebras called strict CQ$^*$-algebras and HCQ$^*$-algebras are studied.
Roughly speaking, a strict CQ$^*$-algebra (resp. HCQ$^*$-algebra) is a Banach
(resp. Hilbert) quasi *-algebra containing a C$^*$-algebra endowed with another
involution $\sharp$ and C$^*$-norm $\| \|_{\sharp}$. HCQ$^*$-algebras are
closely related to left Hilbert algebras. We shall show that a Hilbert space is
a HCQ$^*$-algebra if and only if it contains a left Hilbert algebra with unit
as a dense subspace. Further, we shall give a necessary and sufficient
condition under which a strict CQ$^*$-algebra is embedded in a HCQ$^*$-algebra.

Ortho-to-para ratio of interstellar heavy water,"  Despite the low elemental deuterium abundance in the Galaxy, enhanced
molecular D/H ratios have been found in the environments of low-mass star
forming regions, and in particular the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293-2422. The
CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program aims at
studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high
sensitivity and spectral resolution of the HIFI instrument provide a unique
opportunity to observe the fundamental 1,1,1 - 0,0,0 transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule, inaccessible from the ground, and to determine the
ortho-to-para D2O ratio. We have detected the fundamental transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule at 607.35 GHz towards IRAS 16293-2422. The line is seen in
absorption with a line opacity of 0.62 +/- 0.11 (1 sigma). From the previous
ground-based observations of the fundamental 1,1,0 - 1,0,1 transition of
para-D2O seen in absorption at 316.80 GHz we estimate a line opacity of 0.26
+/- 0.05 (1 sigma). We show that the observed absorption is caused by the cold
gas in the envelope of the protostar. Using these new observations, we estimate
for the first time the ortho to para D2O ratio to be lower than 2.6 at a 3
sigma level of uncertainty, to be compared with the thermal equilibrium value
of 2:1.

"Global solutions of a radiative and reactive gas with self-gravitation
  for higher-order kinetics","  The existence of global solutions is established for compressible
Navier-Stokes equations by taking into account the radiative and reactive
processes, when the heat conductivity $\kappa$
($\kappa_1(1+\theta^q)\leq\kappa\leq \kappa_2(1+\theta^q),q\geq 0$), where

Discrete harmonic analysis on a Weyl alcove,"  We introduce a representation of the double affine Hecke algebra at the
critical level q=1 in terms of difference-reflection operators and use it to
construct an explicit integrable discrete Laplacian on the Weyl alcove
corresponding to an element in the center. The Laplacian in question is to be
viewed as an integrable discretization of the conventional Laplace operator on
Euclidian space perturbed by a delta-potential supported on the reflection
hyperplanes of the affine Weyl group. The Bethe Ansatz method is employed to
show that our discrete Laplacian and its commuting integrals are diagonalized
by a finite-dimensional basis of periodic Macdonald spherical functions.

"Sensitivity Calculations for the Poisson's Equation via the Adjoint
  Field Method","  Adjoint field methods are both elegant and efficient for calculating
sensitivity information required across a wide range of physics-based inverse
problems. Here we provide a unified approach to the derivation of such methods
for problems whose physics are provided by Poisson's equation. Unlike existing
approaches in the literature, we consider in detail and explicitly the role of
general boundary conditions in the derivation of the associated adjoint
field-based sensitivities. We highlight the relationship between the adjoint
field computations required for both gradient decent and Gauss-Newton
approaches to image formation. Our derivation is based on standard results from
vector calculus coupled with transparent manipulation of the underlying partial
different equations thereby making the concepts employed here easily adaptable
to other systems of interest.

Self-Calibrated Cluster Counts as a Probe of Primordial Non-Gaussianity,"  We show that the ability to probe primordial non-Gaussianity with cluster
counts is drastically improved by adding the excess variance of counts which
contains information on the clustering. The conflicting dependences of changing
the mass threshold and including primordial non-Gaussianity on the mass
function and biasing indicate that the self-calibrated cluster counts well
break the degeneracy between primordial non-Gaussianity and the observable-mass
relation. Based on the Fisher matrix analysis, we show that the count variance
improves constraints on f_NL by more than an order of magnitude. It exhibits
little degeneracy with dark energy equation of state. We forecast that upcoming
Hyper Suprime-cam cluster surveys and Dark Energy Survey will constrain
primordial non-Gaussianity at the level \sigma(f_NL) \sim 8, which is
competitive with forecasted constraints from next-generation cosmic microwave
background experiments.

On the Local Minima of the Empirical Risk,"  Population risk is always of primary interest in machine learning; however,
learning algorithms only have access to the empirical risk. Even for
applications with nonconvex nonsmooth losses (such as modern deep networks),
the population risk is generally significantly more well-behaved from an
optimization point of view than the empirical risk. In particular, sampling can
create many spurious local minima. We consider a general framework which aims
to optimize a smooth nonconvex function $F$ (population risk) given only access
to an approximation $f$ (empirical risk) that is pointwise close to $F$ (i.e.,
$\|F-f\|_{\infty} \le \nu$). Our objective is to find the
$\epsilon$-approximate local minima of the underlying function $F$ while
avoiding the shallow local minima---arising because of the tolerance
$\nu$---which exist only in $f$. We propose a simple algorithm based on
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a smoothed version of $f$ that is
guaranteed to achieve our goal as long as $\nu \le O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$. We
also provide an almost matching lower bound showing that our algorithm achieves
optimal error tolerance $\nu$ among all algorithms making a polynomial number
of queries of $f$. As a concrete example, we show that our results can be
directly used to give sample complexities for learning a ReLU unit.

"Throughput Analysis of Network Coding in Multi-Hop Wireless Mesh
  Networks Using Queueing Theory","  In recent years, a significant amount of research has been conducted to
explore the benefits of network coding in different scenarios, from both
theoretical and simulation perspectives. In this paper, we utilize queueing
theory to propose an analytical framework for bidirectional unicast flows in
multi-hop wireless mesh networks, and study throughput of inter-flow network
coding. We analytically determine performance metrics such as the probability
of successful transmission in terms of collision probability, and feedback
mechanism and retransmission. Regarding the coding process, our model uses a
multi-class queueing network where coded packets are separated from native
packets and have a non-preemptive higher priority over native packets, and both
queues are in a stable state. Finally, we use simulations to verify the
accuracy of our analytical model.

quantum dots has been analyzed by means of two different theoretical
approaches: equations of motion for the all orders localized electron
correlation functions, considering interference effects, and kinetic equations
for the pseudo-particle occupation numbers with constraint on the possible
physical states. Results obtained by means of different approaches were
carefully analyzed and compared with each other. Revealed direct link between
concurrence (degree of entanglement) and quantum dots pair correlation
functions allowed us to follow the changes of entanglement during time
evolution of the coupled quantum dots system. It was demonstrated that the
degree of entanglement can be controllably tuned during the time evolution of
quantum dots system.

"Small-depth Multilinear Formula Lower Bounds for Iterated Matrix
  Multiplication, with Applications","  In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$
many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$, and show that the
well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any
depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.
  Formally, for each depth $\Delta \leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth
$\Delta$ multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have size
$\exp(\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})).$ It also follows from this that any
multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ for the same polynomial of the
above form must have a size of $\exp(\Omega(d^{1/\Delta})).$ In particular, any
polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth
$\Omega(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for
$\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these
bounds are tight up to constant factors.
  1. Depth-reduction: A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any
formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth
$O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear
formulas. Our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear
setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial
blow-up in size.
  2. Separations from general formulas: Our result, along with a non-trivial
upper bound for $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal
and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth
$\Delta = o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$
cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{\omega(1)}$ and
product-depth $\Delta,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.

Couplings between the $\rho$ and $D$- and $D^\ast$-mesons,"  We compute couplings between the $\rho$-meson and $D$- and $D^\ast$-mesons -
$D^{(\ast)}\rho D^{(\ast)}$ - that are relevant to phenomenological
meson-exchange models used to analyse nucleon-$D$-meson scattering and explore
the possibility of exotic charmed nuclei. Our framework is built from elements
constrained by Dyson-Schwinger equation studies in QCD, and therefore expresses
a consistent, simultaneous description of light- and heavy-quarks and the
states they constitute, We find that all interactions, including the three
independent $D^{\ast} \rho \,D^{\ast}$ couplings, differ markedly amongst
themselves in strength and also in range, as measured by their evolution with
$\rho$-meson virtuality. As a consequence, it appears that no single coupling
strength or parametrization can realistically be employed in the study of
interactions between $D^{(\ast)}$-mesons and matter.

Spatial averaging and apparent acceleration in inhomogeneous spaces,"  As an alternative to dark energy that explains the observed acceleration of
the universe, it has been suggested that we may be at the center of an
inhomogeneous isotropic universe described by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB)
solution of Einstein's field equations. To test this possibility, it is
necessary to solve the null geodesics. In this paper we first give a detailed
derivation of a fully analytical set of differential equations for the radial
null geodesics as functions of the redshift in LTB models. As an application we
use these equaions to show that a positive averaged acceleration $a_D$ obtained
in LTB models through spatial averaging can be incompatible with cosmological
observations. We provide examples of LTB models with positive $a_D$ which fail
to reproduce the observed luminosity distance $D_L(z)$. Since the apparent
cosmic acceleration $a^{FLRW}$ is obtained from fitting the observed luminosity
distance to a FLRW model we conclude that in general a positive $a_D$ in LTB
models does not imply a positive $a^{FLRW}$.

The trajectory of light ray under Kerr-Taub-NUT space time,"  According to General Relativity, there are three factors namely mass,
rotation and charge that can influence the path of light ray. Many authors
showed that there is another factor which can influence the path of light ray
namely gravitomagnetism. Here we discuss the effect of a rotating body with
non-zero (Kerr- Taub-NUT) magnetic field on the motion of light ray. We use the
null geodesic of photon method and obtain the deflection angle of light ray for
such a body up to fourth order term in the equatorial plane. Our calculation
shows that magnetism has a noticeable effect on the path of light ray. If we
set the magnetism equal to zero, our expression of bending angle reduces to the
Kerr bending angle. However, we get non-zero bending angle for a hypothetical
mass less, magnetic body.

"The stellar orbit distribution in present-day galaxies inferred from the
  CALIFA survey","  Galaxy formation entails the hierarchical assembly of mass, along with the
condensation of baryons and the ensuing, self-regulating star formation. The
stars form a collisionless system whose orbit distribution retains dynamical
memory that can constrain a galaxy's formation history. The ordered-rotation
dominated orbits with near maximum circularity $\lambda_z \simeq1$ and the
random-motion dominated orbits with low circularity $\lambda_z \simeq0$ are
called kinematically cold and kinematically hot, respectively. The fraction of
stars on `cold' orbits, compared to the fraction of stars on `hot' orbits,
speaks directly to the quiescence or violence of the galaxies' formation
histories. Here we present such orbit distributions, derived from stellar
kinematic maps via orbit-based modelling for a well defined, large sample of
300 nearby galaxies. The sample, drawn from the CALIFA survey, includes the
main morphological galaxy types and spans the total stellar mass range from
$10^{8.7}$ to $10^{11.9}$ solar masses. Our analysis derives the
orbit-circularity distribution as a function of galaxy mass,
$p(\lambda_z~|~M_\star)$, and its volume-averaged total distribution,
$p(\lambda_z)$. We find that across most of the considered mass range and
across morphological types, there are more stars on `warm' orbits defined as
$0.25\le \lambda_z \le 0.8$ than on either `cold' or `hot' orbits. This
orbit-based ""Hubble diagram"" provides a benchmark for galaxy formation
simulations in a cosmological context.

Evolving simple programs for playing Atari games,"  Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) has previously shown capabilities in
image processing tasks by evolving programs with a function set specialized for
computer vision. A similar approach can be applied to Atari playing. Programs
are evolved using mixed type CGP with a function set suited for matrix
operations, including image processing, but allowing for controller behavior to
emerge. While the programs are relatively small, many controllers are
competitive with state of the art methods for the Atari benchmark set and
require less training time. By evaluating the programs of the best evolved
individuals, simple but effective strategies can be found.

Moreover, the exposing map for a boundary point can be sufficiently close to

parametric version of this result for bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains in
$\mathbb C^n$. For a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb C^n$ and
a given boundary point of it, we prove that there is a global coordinate change
on the closure of the domain which is arbitrarily close to the identity map
with respect to the $C^1$-norm and maps the boundary point to a strongly convex
boundary point.

"Lagrange Multiplier Local Necessary and Global Sufficiency Criteria for
  Some Non-Convex Programming Problems","  In this paper we consider three minimization problems, namely quadratic,
$\rho$-convex and quadratic fractional programing problems. The quadratic
problem is considered with quadratic inequality constraints with bounded
continuous and discrete mixed variables. The $\rho$-convex problem is
considered with $\rho$-convex inequality constraints in mixed variables. The
quadratic fractional problem is studied with quadratic fractional constraints
in mixed variables. For all three problems we reformulate the problem as a
mathematical programming problem and apply standard Karush Kuhn Tucker
necessary conditions. Then, for each problem, we provide local necessary
optimality condition. Further, for each problem a Lagrangian multiplier
sufficient optimality condition is provided to identify global minimizer among
the local minimizers. For the quadratic problem underestimation of a Lagrangian
was employed to obtain the desired sufficient conditions. For the $\rho$-convex
problem we obtain two sufficient optimality conditions to distinguish a global
minimizer among the local minimizers, one with an underestimation of a
Lagrangian and the other with a different technique. A global sufficient
optimality condition for the quadratic fractional problem is obtained by
reformulating the problem as a quadratic problem and then utilizing the results
of the quadratic problem. Examples are provided to illustrate the significance
of the results obtained.

"Magneto-elastic modes and lifetime of magnons in thin yttrium-iron
  garnet films","  We calculate the effects of the spin-lattice coupling on the magnon spectrum
of thin ferromagnetic films consisting of the magnetic insulator yttrium-iron
garnet. The magnon-phonon hybridisation generates a characteristic minimum in
the spin dynamic structure factor which quantitatively agrees with recent
Brillouin light scattering experiments. We also show that at room temperature
the phonon contribution to the magnon damping exhibits a rather complicated
momentum dependence: In the exchange regime the magnon damping is dominated by
Cherenkov type scattering processes, while in the long-wavelength dipolar
regime these processes are subdominant and the magnon damping is two orders of
magnitude smaller. We supplement our calculations by actual measurements of the
magnon relaxation in the dipolar regime. Our theory provides a simple

"Quenched invariance principle for simple random walk on discrete point
  processes","  We consider the simple random walk on random graphs generated by discrete
point processes. This random graph has a random subset of a cubic lattice as
the vertices and lines between any consecutive vertices on lines parallel to
each coordinate axis as the edges. Under the assumption that discrete point
processes are finitely dependent and stationary, we prove that the quenched
invariance principle holds, that is, for almost every configuration of a point
process, the path distribution of the walk converges weakly to that of a
Brownian motion.

Mathematical model of flux relaxation phenomenon,"  The investigations on the flux relaxation phenomenon of a type-II
superconductor are important because they provide the information about the
flux pinning ability and current-carrying ability of the superconductor.
However, a unified theory of flux relaxation is currently unavailable. Here I
present a general mathematical model of the flux relaxation. In this model, I
proposed a series expansion to the activation energy and derived a general
formula for the current decay behavior. In the light of these formulas, I can
analyze the experimental data on the current decay behavior and then calculate
the activation energy of a vortex system without subjecting to any special
conditions. The results are accurate for the current decay measurements from a
$Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$ superconductor

"Characterizing generalized derivatives of set-valued maps: Extending the
  tangential and normal approaches","  For a set-valued map, we characterize, in terms of its (unconvexified or
convexified) graphical derivatives near the point of interest, positively
homogeneous maps that are generalized derivatives in the sense of [20]. This
result generalizes the Aubin criterion in [9]. A second characterization of
these generalized derivatives is easier to check in practice, especially in the
finite dimensional case. Finally, the third characterization in terms of
limiting normal cones and coderivatives generalizes the Mordukhovich criterion
in the finite dimensional case. The convexified coderivative has a bijective
relationship with the set of possible generalized derivatives. We conclude by
illustrating a few applications of our result.

"An Information Theoretic Measure of Judea Pearl's Identifiability and
  Causal Influence","  In this paper, we define a new information theoretic measure that we call the
""uprooted information"". We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a
probability $P(s|do(t))$ to be ""identifiable"" (in the sense of Pearl) in a
graph $G$ is that its uprooted information be non-negative for all models of
the graph $G$. In this paper, we also give a new algorithm for deciding, for a
Bayesian net that is semi-Markovian, whether a probability $P(s|do(t))$ is
identifiable, and, if it is identifiable, for expressing it without allusions
to confounding variables. Our algorithm is closely based on a previous
algorithm by Tian and Pearl, but seems to correct a small flaw in theirs. In
this paper, we also find a {\it necessary and sufficient graphical condition}
for a probability $P(s|do(t))$ to be identifiable when $t$ is a singleton set.
So far, in the prior literature, it appears that only a {\it sufficient
graphical condition} has been given for this. By ""graphical"" we mean that it is
directly based on Judea Pearl's 3 rules of do-calculus.

{\L}S condition for filled Julia sets in $\mathbb{C}$,"  In this article, we derive an inequality of {\L}ojasiewicz-Siciak type for
certain sets arising in the context of the complex dynamics in dimension 1.
More precisely, if we denote by $dist$ the euclidian distance in $\mathbb{C}$,
we show that the Green function $G_K$ of the filled Julia set $K$ of a
polynomial such that $\mathring{K}\neq \emptyset$ satisfies the so-called {\L}S
condition $\displaystyle G_A\geq c\cdot dist(\cdot, K)^{c'}$ in a neighborhood
of $K$, for some constants $c,c'>0$. Relatively few examples of compact sets
satisfying the {\L}S condition are known. Our result highlights an interesting
class of compact sets fulfilling this condition. The fact that filled Julia
sets satisfy the {\L}S condition may seem surprising, since they are in general
very irregular. In order to prove our main result, we define and study the set
of obstruction points to the {\L}S condition. We also prove, in dimension
$n\geq 1$, that for a polynomially convex and L-regular compact set of non
empty interior, these obstruction points are rare, in a sense which will be
specified.

"Laser-like X-ray Sources Based on Optical Reflection from Relativistic
  Electron Mirror","  A novel scheme is proposed to generate uniform relativistic electron layers
for coherent Thomson backscattering. A few-cycle laser pulse is used to produce
the electron layer from an ultra-thin solid foil. The key element of the new
scheme is an additional foil that reflects the drive laser pulse, but lets the
electrons pass almost unperturbed. It is shown by analytic theory and by 2D-PIC
simulation that the electrons, after interacting with both drive and reflected
laser pulse, form a very uniform flyer freely cruising with high relativistic
gamma-factor exactly in drive laser direction (no transverse momentum). It
backscatters probe light with a full Doppler shift factor of 4*gamma^2. The
reflectivity and its decay due to layer expansion is discussed.

Anti-Ramsey number of edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees,"  An edge-colored graph $G$ is called rainbow if every edge of $G$ receives a
different color. The anti-Ramsey number of $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning
trees, denoted by $r(n,t)$, is defined as the maximum number of colors in an
edge-coloring of $K_n$ containing no $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees.
Jahanbekam and West [J. Graph Theory, 2014] conjectured that for any fixed $t$,
$r(n,t)=\binom{n-2}{2}+t$ whenever $n\geq 2t+2 \geq 6$. In this paper, we prove
this conjecture. We also determine $r(n,t)$ when $n = 2t+1$. Together with
previous results, this gives the anti-Ramsey number of $t$ edge-disjoint
rainbow spanning trees for all values of $n$ and $t$.

Transition-Based Dependency Parsing with Stack Long Short-Term Memory,"  We propose a technique for learning representations of parser states in
transition-based dependency parsers. Our primary innovation is a new control
structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks---the stack LSTM. Like the
conventional stack data structures used in transition-based parsing, elements
can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in
addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents.
This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of
a parser's state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words,
(ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the
complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including
their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for
training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.

The method is easily generalizable to field theories with arbitrary global
symmetry.

hypersurfaces of the Euclidean space.

TYPE II DNA: when the interfacial energy becomes negative,"  An important step in transcription of a DNA base sequence to a protein is the
initiation from the exact starting point, called promoter region. We propose a
physical mechanism for identification of the promoter region, which relies on a
new classification of DNAs into two types, Type-I and Type-II, like
superconductors, depending on the sign of the energy of the interface
separating the zipped and the unzipped phases. This is determined by the
energies of helical ordering and stretching over two independent length scales.
The negative interfacial energy in Type II DNA leads to domains of helically
ordered state separated by defect regions, or blobs, enclosed by the
interfaces. The defect blobs, pinned by non-coding promoter regions, would be
physically distinct from all other types of bubbles. We also show that the
order of the melting transition under a force is different for Type I and Type
II.

"Recent CMB observations enable to find the total gravitational energy of
  a mass","  The astronomical observations indicate that the universe expands with
acceleration and it has a finite event horizon. The recent CMB observations
confirm the universe is homogeneous, isotropic and asymptotically flat. The
total gravitational energy of a body having mass m is the gravitational
potential energy originating from the gravitational interaction of the body
with all masses of the universe, within the event horizon. The flat geometry of
the universe enables to determine the total gravitational energy of the mass m
within the framework of the Newtonian gravity in Euclidean space. By this
approach, it has been found the modulus of the total gravitational energy of a
body is close to its rest energy E = m*c^2, which is a remarkable result.
Besides, the smoothed gravitational potential in an arbitrary point of the
observable universe appears close to - c^2, where c is the speed of the light.

Intersection patterns of finite sets and of convex sets,"  The main result is a common generalization of results on lower bounds for the
chromatic number of r-uniform hypergraphs and some of the major theorems in
Tverberg-type theory, which is concerned with the intersection pattern of faces
in a simplicial complex when continuously mapped to Euclidean space. As an
application we get a simple proof of a generalization of a result of Kriz for
certain parameters. This specializes to a short and simple proof of Kneser's
conjecture. Moreover, combining this result with recent work of Mabillard and
Wagner we show that the existence of certain equivariant maps yields lower
bounds for chromatic numbers. We obtain an essentially elementary proof of the
result of Schrijver on the chromatic number of stable Kneser graphs. In fact,
we show that every neighborly even-dimensional polytope yields a small induced
subgraph of the Kneser graph of the same chromatic number. We furthermore use
this geometric viewpoint to give tight lower bounds for the chromatic number of
certain small subhypergraphs of Kneser hypergraphs.

"Variability of North Atlantic hurricanes: seasonal versus
  individual-event features","  Tropical cyclones are affected by a large number of climatic factors, which
translates into complex patterns of occurrence. The variability of annual
metrics of tropical-cyclone activity has been intensively studied, in
particular since the sudden activation of the N Atl in the mid 1990's. We
provide first a swift overview on previous work by diverse authors about these
annual metrics for the NAtl basin, where the natural variability of the
phenomenon, the existence of trends, the drawbacks of the records, and the
influence of global warming have been the subject of interesting debates. Next,
we present an alternative approach that does not focus on seasonal features but
on the characteristics of single events [Corral et al Nature Phys 6, 693,
2010]. It is argued that the individual-storm power dissipation index (PDI)
constitutes a natural way to describe each event, and further, that the PDI
statistics yields a robust law for the occurrence of tropical cyclones in terms
of a power law. In this context, methods of fitting these distributions are
discussed. As an important extension to this work we introduce a distribution
function that models the whole range of the PDI density (excluding
incompleteness effects at the smallest values), the gamma distribution,
consisting in a power-law with an exponential decay at the tail. The
characteristic scale of this decay, represented by the cutoff parameter,
provides very valuable information on the finiteness size of the basin, via the
largest values of the PDIs that the basin can sustain. We use the gamma fit to
evaluate the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on the occurrence of
extreme PDI values, for which we find an increase around 50 % in the values of
these basin-wide events for a 0.49 degC SST average difference. ...

Limiting interpolation spaces via extrapolation,"  We give a complete characterization of limiting interpolation spa\-ces for
the real method of interpolation using extrapolation theory. For this purpose
the usual tools (e.g., Boyd indices or the boundedness of Hardy type operators)
are not appropriate. Instead, our characterization hinges upon the boundedness
of some simple operators (e.g. $f\mapsto f(t^{2})/t$, or $f\mapsto f(t^{1/2}%
)$) acting on the underlying lattices that are used to control the $K$- and
$J$-functionals. Reiteration formulae, extending Holmstedt's classical
reiteration theorem to limiting spaces, are also proved and characterized in
this fashion. The resulting theory gives a unified roof to a large body of
literature that, using ad-hoc methods, had covered only special cases of the
results obtained here. Applications to Matsaev ideals, Grand Lebesgue spaces,
Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu-Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova limits, as well as a new vector
valued extrapolation theorems, are provided.

The bulk kinetic power of radio jets in active galactic nuclei,"  Based on the K\""onigl's inhomogeneous jet model, we estimate the jet
parameters, such as bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, viewing angle $\theta$ and
electron number density $n_{\rm e}$ from radio VLBI and X-ray data for a sample
of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) assuming that the X-rays are from the jet
rather than the intracluster gas. The bulk kinetic power of jets is then
calculated using the derived jet parameters. We find a strong correlation
between the total luminosity of broad emission lines and the bulk kinetic power
of the jets. This result supports the scenario that the accretion process are
tightly linked with the radio jets, though how the disk and jet are coupled is
not revealed by present correlation analysis. Moreover, we find a significant
correlation between the bulk kinetic power and radio extended luminosity. This
implies that the emission from the radio lobes are closely related with the
energy flux transported through jets from the central part of AGNs.

homogeneity zero and might also be singular both at zero and at infinity. Under
further regularity assumptions on $W$, we will show that for sufficiently small
$\varepsilon$ there exists, up to normalisation of the tail behaviour at
infinity, at most one self-similar profile.

  momentum states for communication links","  We present a novel optical device to encode and decode two bits of
information into different Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) states of a paraxial
optical beam. Our device generates the four angular momentum states of order
$\pm 2$ and $\pm4$ by Spin-To-Orbital angular momentum Conversion (STOC) in a
triangular optical loop arrangement. The switching among the four OAM states is
obtained by changing the polarization state of the circulating beam by two
quarter wave plates and the two-bit information is transferred to the beam OAM
exploiting a single $q$-plate. The polarization of the exit beam is left free
for additional one bit of information. The transmission bandwidth of the device
may be as large as several megahertz if electro-optical switches are used to
change the beam polarization. This may be particularly useful in communication
system based on light OAM.

Domain boundary formation in helical multishell gold nanowire,"  Helical multishell gold nanowire is studied theoretically for the formation
mechanism of helical domain boundary. Nanowires with the wire length of more
than 10 nm are relaxed by quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulation with
tight-binding form Hamiltonian. In results, non-helical nanowires are
transformed into helical ones with the formation of atom pair defects at domain
boundary, where the defective atom pair is moved from an inner shell. Analysis
of local electronic structure shows a competitive feature of the energy gain of
reconstruction on wire surface and the energy loss of the defect formation. A
simple energy scaling theory gives a general discussion of domain boundary
formation.

"Congruent skein relations for colored HOMFLY-PT invariants and colored
  Jones polynomials","  Colored HOMFLY-PT invariant, the generalization of the colored Jones
polynomial, is one of the most important quantum invariants of links. This
paper is devoted to investigating the basic structures of the colored HOMFLY-PT
invariants of links. By using the HOMFLY-PT skein theory, firstly, we show that
the (reformulated) colored HOMFLY-PT invariants actually lie in the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[(q-q^{-1})^2,t^{\pm 1}]$. Secondly, we establish some symmetric
formulas for colored HOMFLY-PT invariants of links, which include the
rank-level duality as an easy consequence. Finally, motivated by the
Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture for framed links, we propose
congruent skein relations for (reformulated) colored HOMFLY-PT invariants which
are the generalizations of the skein relation for classical HOMFLY-PT
polynomials. Then we study the congruent skein relation for colored Jones
polynomials. In fact, we obtain a succinct formula for the case of knot. As an
application, we prove a vanishing result for Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of a
family of 3-manifolds. Finally we study the congruent skein relations for
$SU(n)$ quantum invariants.

"LineCAPTCHA Mobile: A User Friendly Replacement for Unfriendly Reverse
  Turing Tests for Mobile Devices (ICIAfS14)","  As smart phones and tablets are becoming ubiquitous and taking over as the
primary choice for accessing the Internet worldwide, ensuring a secure gateway
to the servers serving such devices become essential. CAPTCHAs play an
important role in identifying human users in internet to prevent unauthorized
bot attacks. Even though there are numerous CAPTCHA alternatives available
today, there are certain drawbacks attached with each alternative, making them
harder to find a general solution for the necessity of a CAPTCHA mechanism.
With the advancing technology and expertise in areas such as AI, cryptography
and image processing, it has come to a stage where the chase between making and
breaking CAPTCHAs are even now. This has led the humans with a hard time
deciphering the CAPTCHA mechanisms. In this paper, we adapt a novel CAPTCHA
mechanism named as LineCAPTCHA to mobile devices. LineCAPTCHA is a new reverse
Turing test based on drawing on top of Bezier curves within noisy backgrounds.
The major objective of this paper is to report the implementation and
evaluation of LineCAPTCHA on a mobile platform. At the same time we impose
certain security standards and security aspects for establishing LineCAPTCHAs
which are obtained through extensive measures. Independency from factors such
as the fluency in English language, age and easily understandable nature of it
inclines the usability of LineCAPTCHA. We believe that such independency will
favour the main target of LineCAPTCHA, user friendliness and usability.

Search for high-energy neutrinos from dust obscured Blazars,"  The recent discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube neutrino
observatory opens up a new field in physics, the field of neutrino astronomy.
Using the IceCube neutrino detector we plan to search for high-energy neutrinos
emitted from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), since AGN are believed to be one of
the most promising sources of the most energetic cosmic rays and hence of
high-energy neutrinos. We discuss a specific type of AGN which we plan to
investigate in more detail with data obtained by the IceCube observatory. The
main properties of the AGN category in which we are interested are given by a
high-energy jet which is pointing in our line of sight defining a class of AGN,
called Blazars, and in particular the ones that are obscured by surrounding
dust. The jet-matter interaction is expected to give an increased high-energy
neutrino production. The properties of this specific type of AGN are expected
to give very distinct features in the electromagnetic spectrum, which are
discussed in detail.

"Effects of Quantized Scalar Fields in Cosmological Spacetimes with Big
  Rip Singularities","  Effects of quantized free scalar fields in cosmological spacetimes with Big
Rip singularities are investigated. The energy densities for these fields are
computed at late times when the expansion is very rapid. For the massless
minimally coupled field it is shown that an attractor state exists in the sense
that, for a large class of states, the energy density of the field
asymptotically approaches the energy density it would have if it was in the
attractor state. Results of numerical computations of the energy density for
the massless minimally coupled field and for massive fields with minimal and
conformal coupling to the scalar curvature are presented. For the massive
fields the energy density is seen to always asymptotically approach that of the
corresponding massless field. The question of whether the energy densities of
quantized fields can be large enough for backreaction effects to remove the Big
Rip singularity is addressed.

"Emission properties of an oscillating point dipole from a gold Yagi-Uda
  nanoantenna array","  We investigate numerically the interaction of an oscillating point dipole
with a periodic array of optical Yagi-Uda nanoantennas in the weak coupling
limit. A very strong near-field enhancement of the dipole emission by the
resonant plasmon mode in the feed element is predicted in this structure. It is
shown that the enhancement strength depends strongly on the dipole position,
the direction of the dipole moment, and the oscillation frequency. The
radiative intensity of the point dipole from appropriate places next to one
feed element may exceed the radiative intensity of an equivalent dipole in
free-space by a factor of hundred. In spite of only one director used in each
nanoantenna of the array, the far-field emission pattern is highly directed.
The radiative efficiency (the ratio of the radiative to the full emission)
appears to be around 20%.

Continued Fractions and Linear Fractional Transformations,"  Rational approximations to a square root $\sqrt{k}$ can be produced by
iterating the transformation $f(x) = (dx+k)/(x+d)$ starting from $\infty$ for
any positive integer $d$. We show that these approximations coincide infinitely
often with continued fraction convergents if and only if $4d^2/(k-d^2)$ is an
integer, in which case the continued fraction has a rich structure. It consists
of the concatenation of the continued fractions of certain explicitly definable
rational numbers, and it belongs to one of infinitely many families of
continued fractions whose terms vary linearly in two parameters. We also give
conditions under which the orbit $\{f^n(\infty)\}$ consists exclusively of
convergents or semiconvergents and prove that with few exceptions it includes
all solutions $p/q$ to the Pell equation $p^2 - k q^2 = \pm 1$.

Wino Dark Matter and Future dSph Observations,"  We discuss the indirect detection of the wino dark matter utilizing gamma-ray
observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). After carefully reviewing
current limits with particular attention to astrophysical uncertainties, we
show prospects of the wino mass limit in future gamma-ray observation by the
Fermi-LAT and the GAMMA-400 telescopes. We find that the improvement of the
so-called $J$-factor of both the classical and the ultra-faint dSphs will play
a crucial role to cover whole mass range of the wino dark matter. For example,
with $\delta (\log_{10}J) = 0.1$ for both the classical and the ultra-faint
dSphs, whole wino dark matter mass range can be covered by 15 years and 10
years data at the Fermi-LAT and GAMMA-400 telescopes, respectively.

Asymptotic decay for a one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation,"  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of finite energy solutions to the
one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear wave equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} =
|u|^{p-1} u$, where $p > 1$. Standard energy methods guarantee global
existence, but do not directly say much about the behaviour of $u(t)$ as $t \to
\infty$. Note that in contrast to higher-dimensional settings, solutions to the
linear equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} = 0$ do not exhibit decay, thus apparently
ruling out perturbative methods for understanding such solutions. Nevertheless,
we will show that solutions for the nonlinear equation behave differently from
the linear equation, and more specifically that we have the average $L^\infty$
decay $\lim_{T \to +\infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \|u(t)\|_{L^\infty_x(\R)}\ dt
= 0$, in sharp contrast to the linear case. An unusual ingredient in our
arguments is the classical Radamacher differentiation theorem that asserts that
Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable.

Non-minimal derivative coupling gravity in cosmology,"  We give a brief review of the non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) scalar
field theory in which there is non-minimal coupling between the scalar field
derivative term and the Einstein tensor. We assume that the expansion is of
power-law type or super-acceleration type for small redshift. The Lagrangian
includes the NMDC term, a free kinetic term, a cosmological constant term and a
barotropic matter term. For a value of the coupling constant that is compatible
with inflation, we use the combined WMAP9 (WMAP9+eCMB+BAO+ $H_0$) dataset, the
PLANCK+WP dataset, and the PLANCK $TT,TE,EE$+lowP+Lensing+ext datasets to find
the value of the cosmological constant in the model. Modeling the expansion
with power-law gives a negative cosmological constants while the phantom
power-law (super-acceleration) expansion gives positive cosmological constant
with large error bar. The value obtained is of the same order as in the
$\Lambda$CDM model, since at late times the NMDC effect is tiny due to small
curvature.

depends only on the dimension $m$ and satisfying the asymptotic estimate $\log

"Social Fingerprinting: detection of spambot groups through DNA-inspired
  behavioral modeling","  Spambot detection in online social networks is a long-lasting challenge
involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently
identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots has
emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go
undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show
that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of
their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling
the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart,
in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account
is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure
for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity
between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots.
Leveraging such characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting
technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in
both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We finally evaluate the
effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three
state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Among the peculiarities of our approach
is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study
online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of
lightweight account characteristics.

"Towards a Simple, and Yet Accurate, Transistor Equivalent Circuit and
  Its Application to the Analysis and Design of Discrete and Integrated
  Electronic Circuits","  Transistors are the cornerstone of modern electronics. Yet, their relatively
complex characteristics, allied with often observed great parameter variation,
remain a challenge for discrete and integrated electronics. Much of transistor
research and applications have relied on transistor models, as well as
respective equivalent circuits, to be employed for circuit analysis and
simulations. Here, a simple and yet accurate transistor equivalent circuit is
derived, based on the Early effect, which involves only the voltage $V_a$ and a
companion parameter $s$. Equations are obtained for currents and voltages in a
common-emitter circuit, allowing the derivation of respective gain functions.
These functions are found to exhibit interesting mathematical structure, with
gain values varying almost linearly with the base current, allowing the gains
to be well characterized in terms of their average and variation values. These
results are applied to deriving a prototypic Early space summarizing the
characteristics of transistors, enriched with recently experimentally obtained
prototypes of NPN and PNP silicon BJTs and alloy germanium transistors. Though
a trade-off between gain and linearity is revealed, a band characterized by
small values of $V_a$ stands out when aiming at both high gain and low
distortion. The Early equivalent model was used also for studying the stability
of circuits under voltage supply oscillations, as well as parallel combinations
of transistors. In the former case, it was verified that more traditional
approaches assuming constant current gain can yield stability factors that
deviate substantially from those derived for the more accurate Early approach.
The equivalent circuit obtained for parallel combinations of transistors was
shown also to closely follow the Early formulation.

formalism. Solvability conditions and eigenfunctions are obtained by using the
singularity structures of quantum momentum functions under some conditions. New
potentials are generated by using the first two states of singular oscillator
for parabolic coordinates.

"An Imaging and Spectral Study of Ten X-Ray Filaments around the Galactic
  Center","  We report the detection of 10 new X-ray filaments using the data from the
{\sl Chandra} X-ray satellite for the inner $6^{\prime}$ ($\sim 15$ parsec)
around the Galactic center (GC). All these X-ray filaments are characterized by
non-thermal energy spectra, and most of them have point-like features at their
heads that point inward. Fitted with the simple absorbed power-law model, the
measured X-ray flux from an individual filament in the 2-10 keV band is $\sim
2.8\times10^{-14}$ to $10^{-13}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the
absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity is $\sim 10^{32}-10^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$
at a presumed distance of 8 kpc to the GC. We speculate the origin(s) of these
filaments by morphologies and by comparing their X-ray images with the
corresponding radio and infrared images. On the basis of combined information
available, we suspect that these X-ray filaments might be pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe) associated with pulsars of age $10^3 \sim 3\times 10^5$ yr. The fact
that most of the filament tails point outward may further suggest a high
velocity wind blowing away form the GC.

On statistical methods of structure function extraction,"  Several methods of statistical analysis are proposed and analyzed in
application for a specific task -- extraction of the structure functions from
the cross sections of deep inelastic interactions of any type. We formulate the
method based on the orthogonal weight functions and on an optimization
procedure of errors minimization as well as methods underlying common $\chi^2$
minimization. Effectiveness of these methods usage is analyzed by comparison of
the statistical parameters such as bias, extraction variance etc., for sample
deep inelastic scattering data set.

Spin and charge thermopower of resonant tunneling diodes,"  We investigate thermoelectric effects in quantum well systems. Using the
scattering approach for coherent conductors, we calculate the thermocurrent and
thermopower both in the spin-degenerate case and in the presence of giant
Zeeman splitting due to magnetic interactions in the quantum well. We find that
the thermoelectric current at linear response is maximal when the well level is
aligned with the Fermi energy and is robust against thermal variations.
Furthermore, our results show a spin voltage generation in response to the
applied thermal bias, giving rise to large spin Seebeck effects tunable with
external magnetic fields, quantum well tailoring and background temperature.

"Deep Alignment Network: A convolutional neural network for robust face
  alignment","  In this paper, we propose Deep Alignment Network (DAN), a robust face
alignment method based on a deep neural network architecture. DAN consists of
multiple stages, where each stage improves the locations of the facial
landmarks estimated by the previous stage. Our method uses entire face images
at all stages, contrary to the recently proposed face alignment methods that
rely on local patches. This is possible thanks to the use of landmark heatmaps
which provide visual information about landmark locations estimated at the
previous stages of the algorithm. The use of entire face images rather than
patches allows DAN to handle face images with large variation in head pose and
difficult initializations. An extensive evaluation on two publicly available
datasets shows that DAN reduces the state-of-the-art failure rate by up to 70%.
Our method has also been submitted for evaluation as part of the Menpo
challenge.

"Beyond Markov Chains, Towards Adaptive Memristor Network-based Music
  Generation","  We undertook a study of the use of a memristor network for music generation,
making use of the memristor's memory to go beyond the Markov hypothesis. Seed
transition matrices are created and populated using memristor equations, and
which are shown to generate musical melodies and change in style over time as a
result of feedback into the transition matrix. The spiking properties of simple
memristor networks are demonstrated and discussed with reference to
applications of music making. The limitations of simulating composing memristor
networks in von Neumann hardware is discussed and a hardware solution based on
physical memristor properties is presented.

"Test of the heavy quark-light diquark approximation for baryons with a
  heavy quark","  We check a commonly used approximation in which a baryon with a heavy quark
is described as a heavy quark-light diquark system. The heavy quark influences
the diquark internal motion reducing the average distance between the two light
quarks. Besides, we show how the average distance between the heavy quark and
any of the light quarks, and that between the heavy quark and the center of
mass of the light diquark, are smaller than the distance between the two light
quarks, which seems to contradict the heavy quark-light diquark picture. This
latter result is in agreement with expectations from QCD sum rules and lattice
QCD calculations. Our results also show that the diquark approximations
produces larger masses than the ones obtained in a full calculation.

Optimal Dynamical Decoupling Sequence for Ohmic Spectrum,"  We investigate the optimal dynamical decoupling sequence for a qubit coupled
to an ohmic environment. By analytically computing the derivatives of the
decoherence function, the optimal pulse locations are found to satisfy a set of
nonlinear equations which can be easily solved. These equations incorporates
the environment information such as high-energy (UV) cutoff frequency \omega_c,
giving a complete description of the decoupling process. The solutions explain
previous experimental and theoretical results of locally optimized dynamical
decoupling (LODD) sequence in high-frequency dominated environment, which were
obtained by purely numerical computation and experimental feedback. As shown in
numerical comparison, these solutions outperform the Uhrig dynamical decoupling
(UDD) sequence by one or more orders of magnitude in the ohmic case.

A Penalty Method for Rank Minimization Problems in Symmetric Matrices,"  The problem of minimizing the rank of a symmetric positive semidefinite
matrix subject to constraints can be cast equivalently as a semidefinite
program with complementarity constraints (SDCMPCC). The formulation requires
two positive semidefinite matrices to be complementary. This is a continuous
and nonconvex reformulation of the rank minimization problem. We investigate
calmness of locally optimal solutions to the SDCMPCC formulation and hence show
that any locally optimal solution is a KKT point.
  We develop a penalty formulation of the problem. We present calmness results
for locally optimal solutions to the penalty formulation. We also develop a
proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) scheme for the penalty
formulation, and investigate the incorporation of a momentum term into the
algorithm. Computational results are presented.

Categorical Judgment with a Variable Decision Rule,"  A new Thurstonian rating scale model uses a variable decision rule (VDR) that
incorporates three previously formulated, distinct decision rules. The model
includes probabilities for choosing each rule, along with Gaussian
representation and criterion densities. Numerical optimisation techniques were
validated through demonstrating that the model fits simulated data tightly. For
simulations with 400 trials per stimulus (tps), useful information emerged
about the generating parameters. However, larger experiments (e.g. 4000 tps)
proved desirable for better recovery of generating parameters and to support
trustworthy choices between competing models by the Akaike Information
Criterion. In reanalyses of experiments by others, the VDR model explained most
of the data better than did classical signal detection theory models.

Equivalences of tame blocks for p-adic linear groups,"  Let p and $\ell$ be two distinct primes, F a p-adic field and n an integer.
We show that any level 0 block of the category of smooth Z $\ell$-valued
representations of GL n (F) is equivalent to the unipotent block of an
appropriate product of GL n i (F i). To this end, we first show that the level
0 category of GL n (F) is equivalent to a category of "" modules "" over a
certain Z $\ell$-algebra "" with many objects "" whose definition only involves n
and the residue field of F. Then we use fine properties of Deligne-Lusztig
cohomology to split this algebra and produce suitable Morita equivalences.

"Current-induced asymmetries of incompressible stripes in narrow quantum
  Hall systems","  We present recent experimental results confirming previously predicted strong
asymmetries of the current distribution in narrow Hall bars under the
conditions of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE). Using a previously
developed self-consistent screening and transport theory of the IQHE, we
investigate how these asymmetries, which are due to a non-linear feedback
effect of the imposed current on the electron distribution in the sample,
depend on relevant parameters, such as the strength of the imposed current, the
magnetic field, the temperature, and the collision broadening of the
Landau-quantized energy bands. We find that many aspects of the experimental
results can be understood within this approach, whereas other aspects require
explicit consideration of mechanism, which enforce the breakdown of the IQHE.

Default Logic and Bounded Treewidth,"  In this paper, we study Reiter's propositional default logic when the
treewidth of a certain graph representation (semi-primal graph) of the input
theory is bounded. We establish a dynamic programming algorithm on tree
decompositions that decides whether a theory has a consistent stable extension
(Ext). Our algorithm can even be used to enumerate all generating defaults
(ExtEnum) that lead to stable extensions.
  We show that our algorithm decides Ext in linear time in the input theory and
triple exponential time in the treewidth (so-called fixed-parameter linear
algorithm).
  Further, our algorithm solves ExtEnum with a pre-computation step that is
linear in the input theory and triple exponential in the treewidth followed by
a linear delay to output solutions.

Efficient simulation of strong system-environment interactions,"  Multi-component quantum systems in strong interaction with their environment
are receiving increasing attention due to their importance in a variety of
contexts, ranging from solid state quantum information processing to the
quantum dynamics of bio-molecular aggregates. Unfortunately, these systems are
difficult to simulate as the system-bath interactions cannot be treated
perturbatively and standard approaches are invalid or inefficient. Here we
combine the time dependent density matrix renormalization group methods with
techniques from the theory of orthogonal polynomials to provide an efficient
method for simulating open quantum systems, including spin-boson models and
their generalisations to multi-component systems.

"Quadratic curvature terms and deformed Schwarzschild-de Sitter black
  hole analogues in the laboratory","  Sound waves on a fluid stream, in a de Laval nozzle, are shown to correspond
to quasinormal modes emitted by black holes that are physical solutions in a
quadratic curvature gravity with cosmological constant. Sound waves patterns in
transsonic regimes at a laboratory are employed here to provide experimental
data regarding generalized theories of gravity, comprised by the exact de
Sitter-like solution and a perturbative solution around the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter standard solution. Using the classical tests of General Relativity to
bound free parameters in these solutions, acoustic perturbations on fluid flows
in nozzles are then regarded to study quasinormal modes of these black holes
solutions, providing deviations of the de Laval nozzle cross-sectional area,
when compared to the Schwarzschild solution. The fluid sonic point in the
nozzle, for sound waves in the fluid, implements the acoustic event horizon
corresponding to quasinormal modes.

"Predicting flow reversals in chaotic natural convection using data
  assimilation","  A simplified model of natural convection, similar to the Lorenz (1963)
system, is compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations in order to
test data assimilation methods and better understand the dynamics of
convection. The thermosyphon is represented by a long time flow simulation,
which serves as a reference ""truth"". Forecasts are then made using the
Lorenz-like model and synchronized to noisy and limited observations of the
truth using data assimilation. The resulting analysis is observed to infer
dynamics absent from the model when using short assimilation windows.
  Furthermore, chaotic flow reversal occurrence and residency times in each
rotational state are forecast using analysis data. Flow reversals have been
successfully forecast in the related Lorenz system, as part of a perfect model
experiment, but never in the presence of significant model error or unobserved
variables. Finally, we provide new details concerning the fluid dynamical
processes present in the thermosyphon during these flow reversals.

Magnetically-coupled piston pump for high-purity gas applications,"  Experiments based on noble elements such as gaseous or liquid argon or xenon
utilize the ionization and scintillation properties of the target materials to
detect radiation-induced recoils. A requirement for high light and charge
yields is to reduce electronegative impurities well below the ppb level. To
achieve this, the target material is continuously circulated in the gas phase
through a purifier and returned to the detector. Additionally, the low
backgrounds necessary dictate low-Rn-emanation rates from all components that
contact the gas.
  Since commercial pumps often introduce electronegative impurities from
lubricants on internal components or through small air leaks, and are not
designed to meet the radiopurity requirements, custom-built pumps are an
advantageous alternative. A new pump has been developed in Muenster in
cooperation with the nEXO group at Stanford University and the nEXO/XENON group
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based on a magnetically-coupled piston in a
hermetically sealed low-Rn-emanating vessel. This pump delivers high
performance for noble gases, reaching more than 210 standard liters per minute
(slpm) with argon and more than 170 slpm with xenon while maintaining a
compression of up to 1.9 bar, demonstrating its capability for noble gas
detectors and other applications requiring high standards of gas purity.

"Propagation of acoustic surface waves on a phononic surface investigated

characterized by variable wave-vectors. The measured SAW frequencies enables
the characterization of the band diagram of this PS sample beyond the first

numerical simulation of elastic modes based on a finite element model. The
observed SAWs are addressed to four Bloch waves characterized by different
frequencies and surface energy localization. Moreover, we measured the SAW

with results from the PS.

"Converged GW quasiparticle energies for transition metal oxide
  perovskites","  The ab initio calculation of quasiparticle (QP) energies is a technically and
computationally challenging problem. In condensed matter physics the most
widely used approach to determine QP energies is the GW approximation. Although
the GW method has been widely applied to many typical semiconductors and
insulators, its application to more complex compounds such as transition metal
oxide perovskites has been comparatively rare, and its proper use is not well
established from a technical point of view. In this work, we have applied the
single-shot G0W0 method to a representative set of transition metal oxide
perovskites including 3d (SrTiO3, LaScO3, SrMnO3, LaTiO3, LaVO3, LaCrO3,
LaMnO3, and LaFeO3), 4d (SrZrO3, SrTcO3, and Ca2RuO4) and 5d (SrHfO3, KTaO3 and
NaOsO3) compounds with different electronic configurations, magnetic orderings,
structural characteristics and bandgaps ranging from 0.1 to 6.1 eV. We discuss
the proper procedure to obtain well converged QP energies and accurate bandgaps
within single-shot G0W0 by comparing the conventional approach based on an
incremental variation of a specific set of parameters (number of bands, energy
cutoff for the plane-wave expansion and number of k-points and the basis-set
extrapolation scheme [Phys. Rev. B 90, 075125 (2014)]. In addition, we have
inspected the difference between the adoption of norm-conserving and ultrasoft
potentials in GW calculations. A minimal statistical analysis indicates that
the correlation of the GW data with the DFT gap is more robust than the
correlation with the experimental gaps; moreover we identify the static
dielectric constant as alternative useful parameter for the approximation of GW
gap in high-throughput automatic procedures. Finally, we compute the QP band
structure and spectra within the random phase approximation and compare the
results with available experimental data.

Randomized Block Cubic Newton Method,"  We study the problem of minimizing the sum of three convex functions: a
differentiable, twice-differentiable and a non-smooth term in a high
dimensional setting. To this effect we propose and analyze a randomized block
cubic Newton (RBCN) method, which in each iteration builds a model of the
objective function formed as the sum of the natural models of its three
components: a linear model with a quadratic regularizer for the differentiable
term, a quadratic model with a cubic regularizer for the twice differentiable
term, and perfect (proximal) model for the nonsmooth term. Our method in each
iteration minimizes the model over a random subset of blocks of the search
variable. RBCN is the first algorithm with these properties, generalizing
several existing methods, matching the best known bounds in all special cases.
We establish ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon)$, ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and ${\cal
O}(\log (1/\epsilon))$ rates under different assumptions on the component
functions. Lastly, we show numerically that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art on a variety of machine learning problems, including cubically
regularized least-squares, logistic regression with constraints, and Poisson
regression.

"The Formation of IRIS Diagnostics. IX. The Formation of the C I 135.58
  Line in the Solar Atmosphere","  The C I 135.58 line is located in the wavelength range of NASA's Interface
Region Imagin Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission. We here study the
formation and diagnostic potential of this line by means of non
local-thermodynamic-equilibrium modeling, employing both 1D and 3D
radiation-magnetohydrodynamic models. The C I/C II ionization balance is
strongly influenced by photoionization by Ly-alpha emission. The emission in
the C I 135.58 line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line
forming region is optically thick. The Doppler shift of the line correlates
strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is
typically located at 1.5 Mm height. With IRIS the C I 135.58 line is usually
observed together with the O I 135.56 line, and from the Doppler shift of both
lines, we obtain the velocity difference between the line forming regions of
the two lines. From the ratio of the C I/O I line core intensity, we can
determine the distance between the C I and the O I forming layers. Combined
with the velocity difference, the velocity gradient at mid-chromospheric
heights can be derived. The C I/O I total intensity line ratio is correlated
with the inverse of the electron density in the mid-chromosphere. We conclude
that the C I 135.58 line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere by
itself, and together with the O I 135.56 line the two lines provide even more
information, which complements other powerful chromospheric diagnostics of IRIS
such as the Mg II h and k lines and the C II lines around 133.5 nm.

Liveness Detection Using Implicit 3D Features,"  Spoofing attacks are a threat to modern face recognition systems. In this
work we present a simple yet effective liveness detection approach to enhance
2D face recognition methods and make them robust against spoofing attacks. We
show that the risk to spoofing attacks can be re- duced through the use of an
additional source of light, for example a flash. From a pair of input images
taken under different illumination, we define discriminative features that
implicitly contain facial three-dimensional in- formation. Furthermore, we show
that when multiple sources of light are considered, we are able to validate
which one has been activated. This makes possible the design of a highly secure
active-light authentication framework. Finally, further investigating the use
of 3D features without 3D reconstruction, we introduce an approximated
disparity-based implicit 3D feature obtained from an uncalibrated stereo-pair
of cameras. Valida- tion experiments show that the proposed methods produce
state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios with nearly no feature
extraction latency.

A CEMP-no star in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pisces II,"  A probable carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star, Pisces II 10694, was
discovered recently in the ultra-faint (UFD) galaxy Pisces II. This galaxy is
supposed to be very old, suspected to include dark matter, and likely formed
the bulk of its stars before the reionisation of the Universe.
  New abundances have been obtained from observations of Pisces II 10694 at the
Kueyen ESO VLT telescope, using the high-efficiency spectrograph: X-Shooter.
  We found that Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star with [Fe/H]=-2.60 dex.
Careful measurements of the CH and C2 bands confirm the enhancement of the C
abundance ([C/Fe]=+1.23). This cool giant has very probably undergone extra
mixing and thus its original C abundance could be even higher. Nitrogen, O, Na,
and Mg are also strongly enhanced, but from Ca to Ni the ratios [X/Fe] are
similar to those observed in classical galactic very metal-poor stars. With its
low Ba abundance ([Ba/Fe] =-1.10 dex) Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star. No
variation in the radial velocity could be detected between the years 2015 and
2017. The pattern of the elements abundance has a shape similar to the pattern
found in galactic CEMP-no stars like CS 22949-037 ([Fe/H]=-4.0) or SDSS
J1349+1407 ([Fe/H]=-3.6). The existence of a CEMP-no star in the UFD galaxy
Pisc II suggests that this small galaxy likely hosted zero-metallicity stars.
This is consistent with theoretical predictions of cosmological models
supporting the idea that UFD galaxies are the living fossils of the first
star-forming systems.

"Predicting the behavior of interacting humans by fusing data from
  multiple sources","  Multi-fidelity methods combine inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with
costly but highfidelity simulations to produce an accurate model of a system of
interest at minimal cost. They have proven useful in modeling physical systems
and have been applied to engineering problems such as wing-design optimization.
During human-in-the-loop experimentation, it has become increasingly common to
use online platforms, like Mechanical Turk, to run low-fidelity experiments to
gather human performance data in an efficient manner. One concern with these
experiments is that the results obtained from the online environment generalize
poorly to the actual domain of interest. To address this limitation, we extend
traditional multi-fidelity approaches to allow us to combine fewer data points
from high-fidelity human-in-the-loop experiments with plentiful but less
accurate data from low-fidelity experiments to produce accurate models of how
humans interact. We present both model-based and model-free methods, and
summarize the predictive performance of each method under dierent conditions.

"Enhancement of flux pinning and high critical current density in
  graphite doped MgB2 superconductor","  We report the synthesis and characterization of graphite (C) doped MgB2-xCx
(x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) samples. The crystal structure and microstructural
characterization have been investigated by x-ray diffractometer and
transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis. The superconducting
properties especially Jc and Hc2 have been measured by employing physical
property measurement system. We found that the graphite doping affects the
lattice parameters as well as the microstructure of MgB2 superconductor. In
case of optimally doped (x=0.1) sample, the critical current density at 5K
corresponds to 1.1 x 10^6 and 5.3 x 10^4 A/cm^2 for 3T and 5T fields
respectively. The upper critical field has been enhanced nearly two times after
doping. The flux pinning behavior has been investigated by flux pinning force
density curve and it reveals that the flux pinning behaviour has improved
significantly by doping. TEM micrographs show the graphite nanoparticles of
size ~5-10 nm which are invariably present in MgB2 grains. These nanoparticles
act as flux pinning centre and are responsible for enhancement of
superconducting properties of MgB2.

"Efficient differentially private learning improves drug sensitivity
  prediction","  Users of a personalised recommendation system face a dilemma: recommendations
can be improved by learning from data, but only if the other users are willing
to share their private information. Good personalised predictions are vitally
important in precision medicine, but genomic information on which the
predictions are based is also particularly sensitive, as it directly identifies
the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has
emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient
if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However,
differentially private learning with current methods does not improve
predictions with feasible data sizes and dimensionalities. Here we show that
useful predictors can be learned under powerful differential privacy
guarantees, and even from moderately-sized data sets, by demonstrating
significant improvements with a new robust private regression method in the
accuracy of private drug sensitivity prediction. The method combines two key
properties not present even in recent proposals, which can be generalised to
other predictors: we prove it is asymptotically consistently and efficiently
private, and demonstrate that it performs well on finite data. Good finite data
performance is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by
decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds,
therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. As already the
simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we
anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields, such
as mobile sensing and social media, in addition to the badly needed precision
medicine solutions.

A User Simulator for Task-Completion Dialogues,"  Despite widespread interests in reinforcement-learning for task-oriented
dialogue systems, several obstacles can frustrate research and development
progress. First, reinforcement learners typically require interaction with the
environment, so conventional dialogue corpora cannot be used directly. Second,
each task presents specific challenges, requiring separate corpus of
task-specific annotated data. Third, collecting and annotating human-machine or
human-human conversations for task-oriented dialogues requires extensive domain
knowledge. Because building an appropriate dataset can be both financially
costly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator
based upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement
learning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator.
Dialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting
point. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real
environment to interact with humans, and continue to be trained online. To ease
empirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new,
publicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the
movie-booking domain, leverages both rules and collected data. The simulator
supports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we
demonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own
agent in the proposed framework.

Numerical exploration of a hexagonal string billiard,"  In this paper we are interested in the motion of a ball inside a billiard
table bounded by a particular smooth curve. This table belongs to a family of
billiards which can all be drawn by a common process: the so-called gardener's
string construction. The classical elliptical billiard is, of course, the
foremost member of this family. So it should come as no surprise that our
hexagonal string billiard shares many basic properties with the latter, but, on
the other hand, also exhibits some essential differences with it.
  We have gathered numerical evidence against the Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture.

Holographic R\'enyi Entropies at Finite Coupling,"  We compute R\'enyi entropies for a spherical entangling surface in
four-dimensional N=4 super-Yang-Mills at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Incorporating the effects of the leading \alpha' corrections to
the low energy effective action of type IIB string theory, we calculate the
leading corrections in inverse powers of the 't Hooft coupling (and the number
of colours). The results are compared with known weak coupling calculations.
Setting the order of the R\'enyi entropy q to one, it reduces to the
entanglement entropy and the strong and weak coupling results match without any
corrections, as expected. In the limit of q going to 0, the relation between
the strong and weak coupling entropies is connected to the known corrections

Conformal field theories with infinitely many conservation laws,"  Globally conformal invariant quantum field theories in a D-dimensional
space-time (D even) have rational correlation functions and admit an infinite
number of conserved (symmetric traceless) tensor currents. In a theory of a
scalar field of dimension D-2 they were demonstrated to be generated by bilocal
normal products of free massless scalar fields with an O(N), U(N), or Sp(2N)
(global) gauge symmetry [BNRT].
  Recently, conformal field theories ""with higher spin symmetry"" were
considered for D=3 in [MZ] where a similar result was obtained (exploiting
earlier study of CFT correlators). We suggest that the proper generalization of
the notion of a 2D chiral algebra to arbitrary (even or odd) dimension is
precisely a CFT with an infinite series of conserved currents. We shall recast
and complement (part of) the argument of Maldacena and Zhiboedov into the
framework of our earlier work. We extend to D=4 the auxiliary Weyl-spinor
formalism developed in [GPY] for D=3. The free field construction only follows
for D>3 under additional assumptions about the operator product algebra. In
particular, the problem of whether a rational CFT in 4D Minkowski space is
necessarily trivial remains open.

"Second order Method for Solving 3D Elasticity Equations with Complex and
  Sharp Interfaces","  Elastic materials are ubiquitous in nature and indispensable components in
man-made devices and equipments. When a device or equipment involves composite
or multiple elastic materials, elasticity interface problems come into play.
The solution of three dimensional (3D) elasticity interface problems is
significantly more difficult than that of elliptic counterparts due to the
coupled vector components and cross derivatives in the governing elasticity
equation. This work introduces the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method
for solving 3D elasticity interface problems. The proposed MIB method utilizes
fictitious values on irregular grid points near the material interface to
replace function values in the discretization so that the elasticity equation
can be discretized using the standard finite difference schemes as if there
were no material interface. The interface jump conditions are rigorously
enforced on the intersecting points between the interface and the mesh lines.
Such an enforcement determines the fictitious values. A number of new technique
are developed to construct efficient MIB schemes for dealing with cross
derivative in coupled governing equations. The proposed method is extensively
validated over both weak and strong discontinuity of the solution, both
piecewise constant and position-dependent material parameters, both smooth and
nonsmooth interface geometries, and both small and large contrasts in the
Poisson's ratio and shear modulus across the interface. Numerical experiments
indicate that the present MIB method is of second order convergence in both
$L_\infty$ and $L_2$ error norms.

"Source Printer Classification using Printer Specific Local Texture
  Descriptor","  The knowledge of source printer can help in printed text document
authentication, copyright ownership, and provide important clues about the
author of a fraudulent document along with his/her potential means and motives.
Development of automated systems for classifying printed documents based on
their source printer, using image processing techniques, is gaining a lot of
attention in multimedia forensics. Currently, state-of-the-art systems require
that the font of letters present in test documents of unknown origin must be
available in those used for training the classifier. In this work, we attempt
to take the first step towards overcoming this limitation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel printer specific local texture descriptor. The highlight of
our technique is the use of encoding and regrouping strategy based on small
linear-shaped structures composed of pixels having similar intensity and
gradient. The results of experiments performed on two separate datasets show
that: 1) on a publicly available dataset, the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms for characters printed in the same font, and 2) on
another dataset\footnote{Code and dataset will be made publicly available with
published version of this paper.} having documents printed in four different
fonts, the proposed method correctly classifies all test samples when
sufficient training data is available in same font setup. In addition, it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross font experiments. Moreover, it
reduces the confusion between the printers of same brand and model.

"Dust and star-formation properties of a complete sample of local
  galaxies drawn from the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue","  We combine Planck HFI data at 857, 545, 353 & 217GHz with data from WISE,
Spitzer, IRAS & Herschel to investigate the properties of a flux limited sample
of local star-forming galaxies. A 545GHz flux density limit was chosen so that
the sample is 80% complete at this frequency, giving a sample of 234 local
galaxies. We investigate the dust emission and star formation properties of the
sample via various models & calculate the local dust mass function. Although
1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very
well (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that
the SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and
10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter
wavelength data, & contributes ~1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is
negligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The
temp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star
formation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often
assumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from ~20 K dust is
powered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated
with star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a
free-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%. We find a median
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.0046; & that this ratio is anti-correlated with
galaxy mass. There is good correlation between dust mass & atomic gas mass
(median M_d/M_HI = 0.022), suggesting that galaxies that have more dust have
more interstellar medium in general. Our derived dust mass function implies a
mean dust mass density of the local Universe (for dust within galaxies), of
7.0+-1.4 x 10^5 M_solar/Mpc, significantly greater than that found in the most
recent estimate using Herschel data.

"Levi-Civita regularization and geodesic flows for the `curved' Kepler
  problem","  We introduce the regularization Levi-Civita parameter for the `curved
Kepler', i.e., motion under the `Kepler-Coulomb' potential in a configuration
space with any constant curvature and metric of any signature type. Consistent
use of this parameter allows to solve the problem of motion (orbit shape and
time evolution along the orbit), thereby extending the use of the Levi-Civita
parameter beyond the usual Kepler problem in a flat Euclidean configuration
space. A `universal' description, where all relations are applicable to the
motions in any space and with any energy follow from our approach, with no need
to discuss separately the cases where the configuration space is flat or where
energy vanishes.
  We also discuss the connection of this `curved Kepler' problem with a
geodesic flow. The well known results by Moser, Osipov and Belbruno are shown
to hold essentially unchanged beyond the flat Euclidean configuration space.
`Curved' Kepler motions with a fixed value of the constant of motion
$\sigma:=-(2E - \kappa_1\kappa_2 J^2)$ on any curved configuration space with
constant curvature $\kappa_1$ and metric of signature type $\kappa_2$ can be
identified with the geodesic flow on a space with curvature $\sigma$ and metric
of the same signature type.

"Hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations of turbulent flows -
  II. Cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters","  The development of turbulent gas flows in the intra-cluster medium and in the
core of a galaxy cluster is studied by means of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
cosmological simulations. A series of six runs was performed, employing
identical simulation parameters but different criteria for triggering the mesh
refinement. In particular, two different AMR strategies were followed, based on
the regional variability of control variables of the flow and on the
overdensity of subclumps, respectively. We show that both approaches, albeit
with different results, are useful to get an improved resolution of the
turbulent flow in the ICM. The vorticity is used as a diagnostic for
turbulence, showing that the turbulent flow is not highly volume-filling but
has a large area-covering factor, in agreement with previous theoretical
expectations. The measured turbulent velocity in the cluster core is larger
than 200 km/s, and the level of turbulent pressure contribution to the cluster
hydrostatic equilibrium is increased by using the improved AMR criteria.

Report: Error estimation of recovered solution in FE analysis,"  The recovery type error estimators introduced by Zienkiewicz and Zhu use a
recovered stress field evaluated from the Finite Element (FE) solution. Their
accuracy depends on the quality of the recovered field. In this sense, accurate
results are obtained using recovery procedures based on the Superconvergent
Patch recovery technique (SPR). These error estimators can be easily
implemented and provide accurate estimates. Another important feature is that
the recovered solution is of a better quality than the FE solution and can
therefore be used as an enhanced solution. We have developed an SPR-type
recovery technique that considers equilibrium and displacements constraints to
obtain a very accurate recovered displacements field from which a recovered
stress field can also be evaluated. We propose the use of these recovered
fields as the standard output of the FE code instead of the raw FE solution.
Techniques to quantify the error of the recovered solution are therefore
needed. In this report we present an error estimation technique that accurately
evaluates the error of the recovered solution both at global and local levels
in the FEM and XFEM frameworks. We have also developed an h-adaptive mesh
refinement strategy based on the error of the recovered solution. As the
converge rate of the error of the recovered solution is higher than that of the
FE one, the computational cost required to obtain a solution with a prescribed
accuracy is smaller than for traditional h-adaptive processes.

"Study of the flux effect on nuclear pressure vessel steel by measurement
  of magnetic properties","  Since Reactor Pressure Vessel steels are ferromagnetic, they provide a
convenient means to monitor changes in the mechanical properties of the
material upon irradiation with high energy particles, by measuring their
magnetic properties. Here, we discuss the correlation between these two
properties (i.e. mechanical and magnetic properties) and microstructure, by
studying the flux effect on the nuclear pressure vessel steel used in reactors
currently under construction in Argentina. Charpy-V notched specimens of this
steel were irradiated in the RA1 experimental reactor at 275{\deg}C with two
lead factors (LFs), 93 and 183. The magnetic properties were studied by means
of DC magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance. The results show that the
coercive field and magnetic anisotropy spatial distribution are sensitive to
the LF and can be explained by taking into account the evolution of the
microstructure with this parameter. The saturation magnetization shows a
dominant dependence on the accumulated damage. Consequently, the mentioned
techniques are suitable to estimate the degradation of the reactor vessel
steel.

"Molecular pillar approach to grow vertical covalent organic framework
  nanosheets on graphene: new hybrid materials for energy storage","  Hybrid 2D-2D materials composed by perpendicularly oriented covalent organic
framework (COFs) and graphene were prepared and tested for energy storage
applications. Diboronic acid molecules covalently attached to graphene oxide
(GO) were used as nucleation sites for directing vertical growth of COF-1
nanosheets (v-COF-GO). The hybrid material shows forest of COF-1 nanosheets
with thickness of ~3 to 15 nm in edge-on orientation relative to GO. The same
reaction performed in absence of molecular pillars resulted in uncontrollable
growth of thick COF-1 platelets parallel to the surface of GO. The v-COF-GO was
converted into conductive carbon material preserving the nanostructure of
precursor with ultrathin porous carbon nanosheets grafted to graphene in
edge-on orientation. It was demonstrated as high-performance electrode material
for supercapacitors. The molecular pillar approach can be used for preparation
of many other 2D-2D materials with control of their relative orientation.

"Spin-orbital groundstates of Superconducting doped topological
  insulators (A Majorana Platform)","  The Bi$_2$Se$_3$ class of topological insulators has recently been shown to
undergo a superconducting transition upon hole or electron doping
(Cu$_x$-Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with T$_C$=3.8$^o$K and Pd$_x$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with
T$_C$=5$^o$K), raising the possibilities that these are the first known
""topological superconductors"" or realizes a superconducting state that can be
potentially used as Majorana platforms (L.A. Wray \textit{et.al.}, Nature Phys.
\textbf{6}, 855-859 (2010)). We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
to examine the full details of the spin-orbital groundstates of these materials
including Bi$_2$Te$_3$, observing that the spin-momentum locked topological
surface states remain well defined and non-degenerate with respect to bulk
electronic states at the Fermi level in the optimally doped superconductor and
obtaining their experimental Fermi energies. The implications of this
unconventional surface (that undergoes superconducting at lower temperatures)
topology are discussed, and we also explore the possibility of realizing the
same topology in superconducting variants of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ (with T$_C$ $\sim$
5$^o$K). Characteristics of the experimentally measured three dimensional bulk
states are examined in detail for these materials with respect to the
superconducting state and topological properties, showing that a single
Majorana fermion zero mode is expected to be bound at each superconducting
vortex on the surface. Systematic measurements also reveal intriguing
renormalization and charge correlation instabilities of the surface-localized
electronic modes.

"Improved Models for Cosmic Infrared Background Anisotropies: New
  Constraints on the IR Galaxy Population","  The power spectrum of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies is
sensitive to the connection between star formation and dark matter halos over
the entire cosmic star formation history. Here we develop a model that
associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos. The
model is based on a parameterized relation between the dust-processed infrared
luminosity and (sub)halo mass. By adjusting 3 free parameters, we attempt to
simultaneously fit the 4 frequency bands of the Planck measurement of the CIB
anisotropy power spectrum. To fit the data, we find that the star-formation
efficiency must peak on a halo mass scale of ~ 5x10^12 solar mass and the
infrared luminosity per unit mass must increase rapidly with redshift. By
comparing our predictions with a well-calibrated phenomenological model for
shot noise, and with a direct observation of source counts, we show that the
mean duty cycle of the underlying infrared sources must be near unity,
indicating that the CIB is dominated by long-lived quiescent star formation,
rather than intermittent short ""star bursts"". Despite the improved flexibility
of our model, the best simultaneous fit to all four Planck channels remains
relatively poor. We discuss possible further extensions to alleviate the
remaining tension with the data. Our model presents a theoretical framework for
a future joint analysis of both background anisotropy and source count
measurements.

Solutions of fractional logistic equations by Euler's numbers,"  In this paper, we solve in the convergence set, the fractional logistic
equation making use of Euler's numbers. To our knowledge, the answer is still
an open question. The key point is that the coefficients can be connected with
Euler's numbers, and then they can be explicitly given. The constrained of our
approach is that the formula is not valid outside the convergence set,
  The idea of the proof consists to explore some analogies with logistic
function and Euler's numbers, and then to generalize them in the fractional
case.

energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and
19.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. All observations are consistent with the
expectations for the standard model Higgs boson.

Distributed delays stabilize neural feedback systems,"  We consider the effect of distributed delays in neural feedback systems. The
avian optic tectum is reciprocally connected with the nucleus isthmi.
Extracellular stimulation combined with intracellular recordings reveal a range
of signal delays from 4 to 9 ms between isthmotectal elements. This observation
together with prior mathematical analysis concerning the influence of a delay
distribution on system dynamics raises the question whether a broad delay
distribution can impact the dynamics of neural feedback loops. For a system of
reciprocally connected model neurons, we found that distributed delays enhance
system stability in the following sense. With increased distribution of delays,
the system converges faster to a fixed point and converges slower toward a
limit cycle. Further, the introduction of distributed delays leads to an
increased range of the average delay value for which the system's equilibrium
point is stable. The enhancement of stability with increasing delay
distribution is caused by the introduction of smaller delays rather than the
distribution per se.

A third-order class-D amplifier with and without ripple compensation,"  We analyse the nonlinear behaviour of a third-order class-D amplifier, and
demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple
compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The
amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of
rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal
(pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the
steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability,
we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer
function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows
how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the
device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation
of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between
the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the
amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the
SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved
through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and
illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the
amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is
rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear
negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal
that slowly modulates the system parameters.

"Vapour-liquid critical parameters of a $2$:$1$ primitive model of ionic
  fluids confined in disordered porous media","  We study the vapour-liquid critical parameters of an ionic fluid confined in
a disordered porous medium by using the theory which combines the collective
variables approach with an extension of the scaled particle theory. The ionic
fluid is described as a two-component charge- and size-asymmetric primitive
model, and a porous medium is modelled as a disordered matrix formed by
hard-spheres obstacles. In the particular case of the fixed valencies $2$:$1$,
the coexistence curves and the corresponding critical parameters are calculated
for different matrix porosities as well as for different diameters of matrix
and fluid particles. The obtained results show that the general trends of the
reduced critical temperature and the reduced critical density with the
microscopic characteristics are similar to the trends obtained in the
monovalent case. At the same time, it is noticed that an ion charge asymmetry
significantly weakens the effect of the matrix presence.

Modelling highway-traffic headway distributions using superstatistics,"  We study traffic clearance distributions (i.e., the instantaneous gap between
successive vehicles) and time headway distributions by applying Beck and
Cohen's superstatistics. We model the transition from free phase to congested
phase with the increase of vehicle density as a transition from the Poisson
statistics to that of the random matrix theory. We derive an analytic
expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson
distribution and Wigner's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the nett
distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of
traffic flow. The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for
single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5.

Timeline Generation: Tracking individuals on Twitter,"  In this paper, we propose a unsupervised framework to reconstruct a person's
life history by creating a chronological list for {\it personal important
events} (PIE) of individuals based on the tweets they published. By analyzing
individual tweet collections, we find that what are suitable for inclusion in
the personal timeline should be tweets talking about personal (as opposed to
public) and time-specific (as opposed to time-general) topics. To further
extract these types of topics, we introduce a non-parametric multi-level
Dirichlet Process model to recognize four types of tweets: personal
time-specific (PersonTS), personal time-general (PersonTG), public
time-specific (PublicTS) and public time-general (PublicTG) topics, which, in
turn, are used for further personal event extraction and timeline generation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on the generation
of timeline for individuals from twitter data. For evaluation, we have built a
new golden standard Timelines based on Twitter and Wikipedia that contain PIE
related events from 20 {\it ordinary twitter users} and 20 {\it celebrities}.
Experiments on real Twitter data quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach.

"Independence of Four Projective Criteria for the Weak Invariance
  Principle","  Let $(X_i)_{i\in\Z}$ be a regular stationary process for a given filtration.
The weak invariance principle holds under the condition

Merlev\`ede (2003), Deddecker, Merlev\'ede and Voln\'y (2007)). In this paper,
we show that this criterion is independent of other known criteria: the
martingale-coboundary decomposition of Gordin (see Gordin (1969, 1973)), the
criterion of Dedecker and Rio (see Dedecker and Rio (2000)) and the condition
of Maxwell and Woodroofe (see Maxwell and Woodroofe (2000), Peligrade and Utev

Low Energy Lorentz Violation in Polymer Quantization Revisited,"  In previous work, it had been shown that polymer quantized scalar field
theory predicts that even an inertial observer can experience spontaneous
excitations. This prediction was shown to hold at low energies. However, in
these papers it was assumed that the polymer scale is constant. But it is
possible to relax this condition and obtain a larger class of theories where
the polymer scale is a function of momentum. Does the prediction of low energy
Lorentz violation hold for all of these theories? In this paper we prove that
it does. We also obtain the modified rates of radiation for some of these
theories.

A search for Cyanopolyynes in L1157-B1,"  We present here a systematic search for cyanopolyynes in the shock region
L1157-B1 and its associated protostar L1157-mm in the framework of the Large
Program ""Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM"" (ASAI), dedicated to chemical surveys
of solar-type star forming regions with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observations of
the millimeter windows between 72 and 272 GHz permitted the detection of
HC$_3$N and its $^{13}$C isotopologues, and HC$_5$N (for the first time in a
protostellar shock region). In the shock, analysis of the line profiles shows
that the emission arises from the outflow cavities associated with L1157-B1 and
L1157-B2. Molecular abundances and excitation conditions were obtained from
analysis of the Spectral Line Energy Distributions under the assumption of
Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium or using a radiative transfer code in the
Large Velocity Gradient approximation. Towards L1157mm, the HC$_3$N emission
arises from the cold envelope ($T_{rot}=10$ K) and a higher-excitation region
($T_{rot}$= $31$ K) of smaller extent around the protostar. We did not find any
evidence of $^{13}$C or D fractionation enrichment towards L1157-B1. We obtain
a relative abundance ratio HC$_3$N/HC$_5$N of 3.3 in the shocked gas. We find
an increase by a factor of 30 of the HC$_3$N abundance between the envelope of
L1157-mm and the shock region itself. Altogether, these results are consistent
with a scenario in which the bulk of HC$_3$N was produced by means of gas phase
reactions in the passage of the shock. This scenario is supported by the
predictions of a parametric shock code coupled with the chemical model
UCL_CHEM.

Dynamic learning of pairwise and three-way entanglement,"  In previous work, we have developed a dynamic learning paradigm for
""programming"" a general quantum computer. A learning algorithm is used to find
a set of parameters for a coupled qubit system such that the system at an
initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement results in the
desired calculation value. This can be thought of as a quantum neural network
(QNN). Here, we apply our method to a system of three qubits, and demonstrate
training the quantum computer to estimate both pairwise and three-way
entanglement.

"Magnetic penetration depth of single crystal SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_y: a fully
  gapped superconducting state","  We report measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$
in single crystals of SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ ($x\simeq y \simeq 0.2$) with $T_c
\simeq 45$ K. We find that at low temperature $\lambda$ has an exponential
temperature dependence which suggests that the Fermi surface is fully gapped.
The magnitude of the minimum energy gap, $\Delta_1=1.1\pm 0.1 k_BT_c$ at T=0 K,
is significantly smaller than the BCS weak-coupling value suggesting that the
gap is either strongly anisotropic or varies significantly between the
different Fermi surface sheets. Our data fits well a two gap model with an
additional larger gap of magnitude $\Delta_2 = 1.8\pm0.2 k_BT_c$ which is
associated with $\sim 80$% of the total superfluid density.

Super-resolution on the Sphere using Convex Optimization,"  This paper considers the problem of recovering an ensemble of Diracs on a
sphere from its low resolution measurements. The Diracs can be located at any
location on the sphere, not necessarily on a grid. We show that under a
separation condition, one can recover the ensemble with high precision by a
three-stage algorithm, which consists of solving a semi-definite program, root
finding and least-square fitting. The algorithm's computation time depends
solely on the number of measurements, and not on the required solution
accuracy. We also show that in the special case of non-negative ensembles, a
sparsity condition is sufficient for recovery. Furthermore, in the discrete
setting, we estimate the recovery error in the presence of noise as a function
of the noise level and the super-resolution factor.

"Combined modeling of sparse and dense noise for improvement of Relevance
  Vector Machine","  Using a Bayesian approach, we consider the problem of recovering sparse
signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models
outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods
simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of
no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating
the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the
RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined
noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix.
We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric
sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be
computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse
signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations,
we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several
applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price
prediction and image denoising.

MCMC for Variationally Sparse Gaussian Processes,"  Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine
learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three
issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is
large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and
how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper
simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the
posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form.
The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a
non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters
simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs.
Code to replicate each experiment in this paper will be available shortly.

A Multiple-Valued Plateau Problem,"  The existence of Dirichlet minimizing multiple-valued functions for given
boundary data has been known since pioneering work of F. Almgren. Here we prove
a multiple-valued analogue of the classical Plateau problem of the existence of
area-minimizing mappings of the disk. Specifically, we find, for $K \in \mathbb
N,$ $k_1,...,k_K\in \mathbb N$ with sum $Q$ and any collection of $K$ disjoint
Lipschitz Neighborhood Retract Jordan curves, optimal multiple-valued boundary
data with these multiplicities which extends to a Dirichlet minimizing
$Q$-valued function with minimal Dirichlet energy among all possible monotone
parameterizations of the boundary curves. Under a condition analogous to the
Douglas condition for minimizers from planar domains, conformality of the
minimizer follows from topological methods and some complex analysis. Finally,
we analyze two particular cases: in contrast to single-valued Douglas
solutions, we first give a class of examples for which our multiple-valued
Plateau solution has branch points. Second, we give examples of a degenerate
behavior, illustrating the weakness of the multiple-valued maximum principle
and provide motivation for our analogous Douglas condition.

"Indices of Power in Optimal IDS Default Configuration: Theory and
  Examples","  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are becoming essential to protecting
modern information infrastructures. The effectiveness of an IDS is directly
related to the computational resources at its disposal. However, it is
difficult to guarantee especially with an increasing demand of network capacity
and rapid proliferation of attacks. On the other hand, modern intrusions often
come as sequences of attacks to reach some predefined goals. It is therefore
critical to identify the best default IDS configuration to attain the highest
possible overall protection within a given resource budget. This paper proposes
a game theory based solution to the problem of optimal signature-based IDS
configuration under resource constraints. We apply the concepts of indices of
power, namely, Shapley value and Banzhaf-Coleman index, from cooperative game
theory to quantify the influence or contribution of libraries in an IDS with
respect to given attack graphs. Such valuations take into consideration the
knowledge on common attack graphs and experienced system attacks and are used
to configure an IDS optimally at its default state by solving a knapsack
optimization problem.

On endomorphisms of torsion-free hyperbolic groups,"  Let $H$ be a torsion-free $\delta$-hyperbolic group with respect to a finite
generating set $S$. Let $a_1,..., a_n$ and $a_{1*},..., a_{n*}$ be elements of
$H$ such that $a_{i*}$ is conjugate to $a_i$ for each $i=1,..., n$. Then, there
is a uniform conjugator if and only if $W(a_{1*},..., a_{n*})$ is conjugate to
$W(a_1,..., a_n)$ for every word $W$ in $n$ variables and length up to a
computable constant depending only on $\delta$, $\sharp{S}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n
|a_i|$.
  As a corollary, we deduce that there exists a computable constant
$\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}(\delta, \sharp S)$ such that, for any endomorphism
$\phi$ of $H$, if $\phi(h)$ is conjugate to $h$ for every element $h\in H$ of
length up to $\mathcal {C}$, then $\phi$ is an inner automorphism.
  Another corollary is the following: if $H$ is a torsion-free conjugacy
separable hyperbolic group, then $\text{\rm Out}(H)$ is residually finite.
  When particularizing the main result to the case of free groups, we obtain a
solution for a mixed version of the classical Whitehead's algorithm.

"A cosmographic analysis of the transition to acceleration using SN-Ia
  and BAO","  We explore the distance-redshift relation using a cosmographic methodology,
and show how the cosmographic parameters can be used to determine the redshift
of transition from deceleration to acceleration. Such a transition at a low
redshift occupies only a small region of the available parameter space, and the
prior assumption of an early period of deceleration can significantly change
the posterior constraints. We use available type Ia Supernovae (SN-Ia) and
Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data sets to determine the cosmographic
deceleration $q_0$, jerk $j_0$, snap $s_0$ and lerk $l_0$ parameters. The
parameters are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model for a flat universe
within 2-sigma. We derive constraints on the redshift of transition from
deceleration to acceleration for the different expansions, and find $z_{\rm
acc} > 0.14$ at 95% confidence in the most conservative case.

"A hybrid on-chip opto-nanomechanical transducer for ultra-sensitive
  force measurements","  Nanomechanical oscillators have been employed as transducers to measure
force, mass and charge with high sensitivity. They are also used in opto- or
electromechanical experiments with the goal of quantum control and phenomena of
mechanical systems. Here, we report the realization and operation of a hybrid
monolithically integrated transducer system consisting of a high-$Q$
nanomechanical oscillator with modes in the MHz regime coupled to the
near-field of a high-$Q$ optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. The
transducer system enables a sensitive resolution of the nanomechanical beam's
thermal motion with a signal-to-noise of five orders of magnitude and has a
force sensitivity of $74\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. We
show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the sensitivity of continuous
incoherent force detection improves only with the fourth root of the averaging
time. Using dissipative feedback based on radiation pressure enabled control,
we explicitly demonstrate by detecting a weak incoherent force that this
constraint can be significantly relaxed. We achieve a more than 30-fold
reduction in averaging time with our hybrid transducer and are able to detect
an incoherent force having a force spectral density as small as
$15\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ within $35\,\rm{s}$ of averaging. This
corresponds to a signal which is 25 times smaller than the thermal noise and
would otherwise remain out of reach. The reported monolithic platform is an
enabling step towards hybrid nanomechanical transducers relying on the
light-mechanics interface.

"An experimental test of the viscous anisotropy hypothesis for partially
  molten rocks","  Chemical differentiation of rocky planets occurs by melt segregation away
from the region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex
and incompletely understood. In partially molten rocks undergoing shear
deformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field;
it has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an
anisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic
viscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle
of melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same
theoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due
to a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to
segregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation
experiments on partially molten rocks that test this prediction.
Microstructural analyses of the distribution of melt and solid reveal a radial
gradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder.
The extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain,
consistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and
experimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is
critical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution
of Earth.

Here we introduce two exactly-solvable models where the CTAP protocol can be

models are synthesized from time-dependent second-quantization Hamiltonians, in
which the bosonic field operators evolve adiabatically like in an ordinary
three-level CTAP scheme thus ensuring adiabatic passage in Fock space.

Safe Control under Uncertainty,"  Controller synthesis for hybrid systems that satisfy temporal specifications
expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn
the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such
temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example,
many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through
machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we
propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an
expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce
probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe
controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption
that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables.
One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is
adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its
beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We
demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL
specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and
autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.

RoboChain: A Secure Data-Sharing Framework for Human-Robot Interaction,"  Robots have potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world
around us. One of their largest potentials is in the domain of mobile health
where they can be used to facilitate clinical interventions. However, to
accomplish this, robots need to have access to our private data in order to
learn from these data and improve their interaction capabilities. Furthermore,
to enhance this learning process, the knowledge sharing among multiple robot
units is the natural step forward. However, to date, there is no
well-established framework which allows for such data sharing while preserving
the privacy of the users (e.g., the hospital patients). To this end, we
introduce RoboChain - the first learning framework for secure, decentralized
and computationally efficient data and model sharing among multiple robot units
installed at multiple sites (e.g., hospitals). RoboChain builds upon and
combines the latest advances in open data access and blockchain technologies,
as well as machine learning. We illustrate this framework using the example of
a clinical intervention conducted in a private network of hospitals.
Specifically, we lay down the system architecture that allows multiple robot
units, conducting the interventions at different hospitals, to perform
efficient learning without compromising the data privacy.

"The influence of memory in deterministic walks in random media:
  analytical calculation within a mean field approximation","  Consider a random medium consisting of points randomly distributed so that
there is no correlation among the distances. This is the random link model,
which is the high dimensionality limit (mean field approximation) for the
euclidean random point structure. In the random link model, at discrete time
steps, the walker moves to the nearest site, which has not been visited in the
last $\mu$ steps (memory), producing a deterministic partially self avoiding
walk (the tourist walk). We have obtained analitically the distribution of the
number $n$ of points explored by a walker with memory $\mu = 2$, as well as the
transient and period joint distribution. This result enables to explain the
abrupt change in the exploratory behavior between the cases $\mu = 1$
(memoryless, driven by extremal statistics) and $\mu = 2$ (with memory, driven
by combinatorial statistics). In the $\mu = 1$ case, the mean newly visited
points in the thermodynamic limit $(N \gg 1)$ is just $<n > = e = 2.72 ...$
while in the $\mu = 2$ case, the mean number $<n>$ of visited points is
proportional to $N^{1/2}$. Also, this result allows us to stabilish an
equivalence between the random link model with $\mu=2$ and random map
(uncorrelated back and forth distances) with $\mu=0$ and the drastic change
between the cases where the transient time is null compared to non-null
transient times.

About disposition of energy levels,"  The unique properties of central potential of the form $-\beta
e^{-r}r^{\gamma}$ were studied using the recently developed critical parameter
technique. The particular cases of $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=-1$ yield,
respectively, the exponential and Yukawa potentials widely used in the atomic,
molecular and nuclear physics. We found different behavior of the energy levels
of this potential for three different ranges of the value of $\gamma$. For
$\gamma\geq0$ it was found that the energy of bound states with the same
principal quantum number $N$ decreases with increasing angular momentum $\ell$.
The Gaussian and Woods-Saxon potentials also show this behavior. On the
contrary, for $-2\leq\gamma\leq-1$ increasing $\ell$ gives a higher energy,
resembling the Hulthen potential. However, a potential with $-1<\gamma<0$
possesses mixed properties, which give rise to several interesting results. For
one, the order of energy levels with different quantum numbers is not preserved
when varying the parameter $\beta$. This leads to a quantum degeneracy of the
states, and in fact, for a given value of $\gamma$ we can find the values
$\beta_{thr}$ for which two energy levels with different quantum numbers
coincide. Another interesting phenomena is the possibility, for some values of
$\gamma$ in this range, for two new energy levels with different quantum
numbers to appear simultaneously when $\beta$ reaches their common critical
value.

"Hidden multipolar orders of dipole-octupole doublets on a triangular
  lattice","  Motivated by the recent development in strong spin-orbit-coupled materials,
we consider the dipole-octupole doublets on the triangular lattice. We propose
the most general interaction between these unusual local moments. Due to the
spin-orbit entanglement and the special form of its wavefunction, the
dipole-octupole doublet has a rather peculiar property under the lattice
symmetry operation. As a result, the interaction is highly anisotropic in the
pseudospin space, but remarkably, is uniform spatially. We analyze the ground
state properties of this generic model and emphasize the hidden multipolar
orders that emerge from the dipolar and octupolar interactions. We clarify the
quantum mutual modulations between the dipolar and octupolar orders. We predict
the experimental consequences of the multipolar orders and propose the
rare-earth triangular materials as candidate systems for these unusual
properties.

"Gaussian covariance matrices for anisotropic galaxy clustering
  measurements","  Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific
source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance
estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models
of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of
accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance
is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on
simulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology
dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this
work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of
anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.
Considering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and
projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering
wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic
clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case
of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of
this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space
covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy
catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body
simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good
agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic
catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.

which depends on the phase.

Doppler effect of time and space,"  This paper shows as the relativistic Doppler effect can be extended also to
time and space associated to moving bodies. This extension derives from the
analysis of the wave-fronts of the light emitted by a moving source in inertial
motion in the empty space, as viewed from the stationary reference. Indeed,
time and space can be represented by the same vector quantities, which appear
asymmetrical in forward and back direction along the path of the moving body.
Consequently, the whole size of the moving bodies dilates along the direction

"Integration of Differential Gene-combination Search and Gene Set
  Enrichment Analysis: A General Approach","  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and its variations aim to discover
collections of genes that show moderate but coordinated differences in
expression. However, such techniques may be ineffective if many individual
genes in a phenotype-related gene set have weak discriminative power. A
potential solution is to search for combinations of genes that are highly
differentiating even when individual genes are not. Although such techniques
have been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to any
significant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinations
and the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided by
gene groups of different sizes.
  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, we
propose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure that
reduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes by
summarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene in
a single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores from
combinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures by
mapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data sets
demonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search can
enhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that include
genes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminative
power. Also, gene sets discovered by the integrative framework share several
common biological processes and improve the consistency of the results among
three lung cancer data sets.

"Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet imaging of the jet in 3C273: a
  common emission component from optical to X-rays","  We present far-ultraviolet (UV) observations at 150 nm of the jet of the
quasar 3C 273 obtained with the Advanced Camera for Survey's Solar Blind
Channel (ACS/SBC) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. While the jet morphology
is very similar to that in the optical and near-ultraviolet, the spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of the jet's sub-regions show an upturn in nu f_nu
at 150 nm compared to 300 nm everywhere in the jet. Moreover, the 150 nm flux
is compatible with extrapolating the X-ray power-law down to the ultra-violet
region. This constitutes strong support for a common origin of the jet's far-UV
and X-ray emission. It implies that even a substantial fraction of the *visible
light* in the X-ray brightest parts of the jet arises from the same spectral
component as the X-rays, as had been suggested earlier based on Spitzer Space
Telescope observations. We argue that the identification of this UV/X-ray
component opens up the possibility to establish the synchrotron origin of the
X-ray emission by optical polarimetry.

Using highly excited baryons to catch the quark mass,"  Chiral symmetry in QCD can be simultaneously in Wigner and Goldstone modes,
depending on the part of the spectrum examined. The transition regime between
both, exploiting for example the onset of parity doubling in the high baryon
spectrum, can be used to probe the running quark mass in the mid-IR power-law
regime. In passing we also argue that three-quark states naturally group into
same-flavor quartets, split into two parity doublets, all splittings decreasing
high in the spectrum. We propose that a measurement of masses of high-partial
wave Delta* resonances should be sufficient to unambiguously establish the
approximate degeneracy and see the quark mass running. We test these concepts
with the first computation of the spectrum of high-J excited baryons in a
chiral-invariant quark model.

"KELT-19Ab: A P~4.6 Day Hot Jupiter Transiting a Likely Am Star with a
  Distant Stellar Companion","  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits the
moderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an
orbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion
via a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<
4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which
indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =
-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}
=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =
1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm
0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm
0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times
10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium
temperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm
2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to
other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced
in metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an
Am star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting
planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal
the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a
projected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity
measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to
have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow
rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to
have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the
transiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.

The star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the COSMOS field,"  We explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for
3.6um-selected galaxies of different M_* in the COSMOS field. The average SFR
for sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4GHz radio continuum
emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (SF)
that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame
optical SED. At 0.2<z<3 both populations show a strong and M_*-independent
decrease in their SSFR towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,
where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for SF sources. The decrease appears to
have started at z>2, at least above 4x10^10M_Sun where our conclusions are most
robust. We find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR (M_*)^beta,
between SSFR and M_* at all z. It tends to flatten below ~10^10M_Sun if
quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_SFG
-0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher M_* objects always have lower
SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an
upper SSFR-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. It is suggested by a
flattening of the SSFR-M_* relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive
(>10^10M_Sun) galaxies only at the highest z. Below z=1.5 there thus is no
direct evidence that galaxies of higher M_* experience a more rapid waning of
their SSFR than lower M_* SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any
strong 'downsizing'. We combine our results with recent measurements of the
galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of
a SF galaxy (M_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)M_Sun). In this sense, too, there is no
'downsizing'. Our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density
determination with a single technique to z=3. Recent Herschel results are
consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

all hospitals to share information as well as integrate their systems for

drugs. This research work is aimed at integrating of database systems of
hospital across geographical areas via a service bus. A centralized service bus
was used to facilitate interoperability of applications across platforms and
enhance communication within the hospital infrastructure as well as creating
enabling environment for new layer of abstractions to be added without
modification of the entire system. Concept of Service Oriented Architecture
with web services was used for rapid integration solution in solving the

"Missing baryons traced by the galaxy luminosity density in the
  large-scale WHIM filaments","  We propose a new approach to the missing baryons problem. Building on the
common assumption that the missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot
Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), we further assumed here that the galaxy luminosity
density can be used as a tracer of the WHIM. The latter assumption is supported
by our finding of a significant correlation between the WHIM density and the
galaxy luminosity density in the hydrodynamical simulations of Cui et al.
(2012). We further found that the fraction of the gas mass in the WHIM phase is
substantially (by a factor of $\sim$1.6) higher within the large scale galactic
filaments, i.e. $\sim$70\%, compared to the average in the full simulation
volume of $\sim$0.1\,Gpc$^3$. The relation between the WHIM overdensity and the
galaxy luminosity overdensity within the galactic filaments is consistent with
linear: $\delta_{\rm whim}\,=\,0.7\,\pm\,0.1\,\times\,\delta_\mathrm{LD}^{0.9
\pm 0.2}$. We applied our procedure to the line of sight to the blazar
H2356-309 and found evidence for the WHIM in correspondence of the Sculptor
Wall (z $\sim$0.03 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$) and Pisces-Cetus
superclusters (z $\sim$0.06 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.7^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$), in
agreement with the redshifts and column densities of the X-ray absorbers
identified and studied by Fang et al. (2010) and Zappacosta et al. (2010). This
agreement indicates that the galaxy luminosity density and galactic filaments
are reliable signposts for the WHIM and that our method is robust in estimating
the WHIM density. The signal that we detected cannot originate from the halos
of the nearby galaxies since they cannot account for the large WHIM column
densities that our method and X-ray analysis consistently find in the Sculptor
Wall and Pisces-Cetus superclusters.

P-adic Asai L-functions of Bianchi modular forms,"  The Asai (or twisted tensor) $L$-function of a Bianchi modular form $\Psi$ is
the $L$-function attached to the tensor induction to $\mathbb{Q}$ of its
associated Galois representation. In this paper, when $\Psi$ is ordinary at $p$
we construct a $p$-adic analogue of this $L$-function: that is, a $p$-adic
measure on $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ that interpolates the critical values of the
Asai $L$-function twisted by Dirichlet characters of $p$-power conductor. The
construction uses techniques analogous to those used by Lei, Zerbes and the
first author in order to construct an Euler system attached to the Asai
representation of a quadratic Hilbert modular form.

Doppler-Broadened Iron X-ray Lines from Tycho's Supernova Remnant,"  We use \suzaku observations to measure the spatial variation of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line with radius in the \tycho supernova remnant. The Fe line widths
show a significant decrease from a FWHM value of 210 eV at the center to 130 eV
at the rim. Over the same radial range the line center energy remains nearly
constant. These observations are consistent with a scenario in which the shell
of Fe-emitting ejecta in \tycho is expanding at speeds of 2800--3350 km
s$^{-1}$. The minimum line width we measure is still a factor of two larger
than expected from a single component plasma emission model. If thermal Doppler
broadening is the dominant additional source of broadening, we infer an ion
temperature of $(1--3) \times 10^{10}$ K.

Towards applied theories based on computability logic,"  Computability logic (CL) (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) is a
recently launched program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of
computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that logic has more
traditionally been. Formulas in it represent computational problems, ""truth""
means existence of an algorithmic solution, and proofs encode such solutions.
Within the line of research devoted to finding axiomatizations for ever more
expressive fragments of CL, the present paper introduces a new deductive system
CL12 and proves its soundness and completeness with respect to the semantics of
CL. Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering
considerable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a
reasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical
logic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such
theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano
arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of
the present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author
wishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of
interesting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual
metatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems.

"Secure and Robust Authentication for DC MicroGrids based on Power Talk
  Communication","  We propose a novel framework for secure and reliable authentication of
Distributed Energy Resources to the centralized secondary/tertiary control
system of a DC MicroGrid (MG), networked using the IEEE 802.11 wireless
interface. The key idea is to perform the authentication using power talk,
which is a powerline communication technique executed by the primary control
loops of the power electronic converters, without the use of a dedicated
hardware for its modem. In addition, the scheme also promotes direct and active
participation of the control system in the authentication process, a feature
not commonly encountered in current networked control systems for MicroGrids.
The PLECS-based simulations verifies the viability of our scheme.

Stable Cosmic Time Crystals,"  Cosmological time crystals are created when a scalar field moves periodically
through phase space in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime
due to the presence of a limit cycle. All such cosmological time crystals in
the literature suffer from gradient instabilities occurring at Null Energy
Condition violating phases where the square sound speed for cosmological
perturbations becomes negative. Here we present stable cosmological time
crystals. Our analysis suggests this new form of scalar matter--cosmic time
crystals--may be considered as a physically viable cosmological matter source.

Roper resonances in chiral quark models,"  We derive a method to calculate the multi-channel K matrix applicable to a
broad class of models in which mesons linearly couple to the quark core. The
method is used to calculate pion scattering amplitudes in the energy region of
low-lying P11 and P33 resonances. A good agreement with experimental data is
achieved if in addition to the elastic channel we include the $\pi\Delta$ and
$\sigma N$ ($\sigma\Delta$) channels where the $\sigma$-meson models the
correlated two-pion decay. We solve the integral equation for the K matrix in
the approximation of separable kernels; it yields a sizable increase of the
widths of the $\Delta(1232)$ and the N(1440) resonances compared to the bare
quark values.

Compact vortex in a generalized Born-Infeld model,"  We study vortexlike solutions in a generalized Born-Infeld model. The model
is driven by two distinct parameters, one which deals with the Born-Infeld
term, and the other, which controls the presence of high-order power term in
the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. We numerically solve the equations
of motion and depict the main vortex features, for several values of the two
parameters of the model. The results indicate the presence of compact vortex,

"Verification of Inconsistency-Aware Knowledge and Action Bases (Extended
  Version)","  Description Logic Knowledge and Action Bases (KABs) have been recently
introduced as a mechanism that provides a semantically rich representation of
the information on the domain of interest in terms of a DL KB and a set of
actions to change such information over time, possibly introducing new objects.
In this setting, decidability of verification of sophisticated temporal
properties over KABs, expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus, has
been shown. However, the established framework treats inconsistency in a
simplistic way, by rejecting inconsistent states produced through action
execution. We address this problem by showing how inconsistency handling based
on the notion of repairs can be integrated into KABs, resorting to
inconsistency-tolerant semantics. In this setting, we establish decidability
and complexity of verification.

Deformations of nearly parallel G_2-structures,"  We study the infinitesimal deformations of a proper nearly parallel
G_2-structure and prove that they are characterized by a certain first order
differential equation. In particular we show that the space of infinitesimal
deformations modulo the group of diffeomorphisms is isomorphic to a subspace of
co-closed $\Lambda^3_{27}$-eigenforms of the Laplace operator for the
eigenvalue 8 scal/21. We give a similar description for the space of
infinitesimal Einstein deformations of a fixed nearly parallel G_2-structure.
Moreover we show that there are no deformations on the squashed S^7 and on
SO(5)/SO(3), but that there are infinitesimal deformations on the Aloff-Wallach
manifold N(1,1) = SU(3)/U(1).

"A Novel Solution to the Dynamic Routing and Wavelength Assignment
  Problem in Transparent Optical Networks","  We present an evolutionary programming algorithm for solving the dynamic
routing and wavelength assignment (DRWA) problem in optical wavelength-division
multiplexing (WDM) networks under wavelength continuity constraint. We assume
an ideal physical channel and therefore neglect the blocking of connection
requests due to the physical impairments. The problem formulation includes
suitable constraints that enable the algorithm to balance the load among the
individuals and thus results in a lower blocking probability and lower mean
execution time than the existing bio-inspired algorithms available in the
literature for the DRWA problems. Three types of wavelength assignment
techniques, such as First fit, Random, and Round Robin wavelength assignment
techniques have been investigated here. The ability to guarantee both low
blocking probability without any wavelength converters and small delay makes
the improved algorithm very attractive for current optical switching networks.

The Donaldson Thomas invariants of X is shown to be zero if the curve class has
is component on S not a multiple of [C]. For nonzero case, when the prime field
insertion are above C, the invariant is shown to depend only on the analytic
neighborhood of L in X.

Measurement of exciton correlations using electrostatic lattices,"  We present a method for determining correlations in a gas of indirect
excitons in a semiconductor quantum well structure. The method involves
subjecting the excitons to a periodic electrostatic potential that causes
modulations of the exciton density and photoluminescence (PL). Experimentally
measured amplitudes of energy and intensity modulations of exciton PL serve as
an input to a theoretical estimate of the exciton correlation parameter and
temperature. We also present a proof-of-principle demonstration of the method
for determining the correlation parameter and discuss how its accuracy can be
improved.

"Searches of exotic Higgs bosons in general mass spectra of the
  Georgi-Machacek model at the LHC","  We derive the most general sets of viable mass spectra of the exotic Higgs
bosons in the Georgi-Machacek model that are consistent with the theoretical
constraints of vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity and the experimental
constraints of electroweak precision observables, $Zb \bar b$ coupling and
Higgs boson signal strengths. Branching ratios of various cascade decay
channels of the doubly-charged Higgs boson in the ${\bf 5}$ representation, the
singly-charged Higgs boson in ${\bf 3}$, and the singlet Higgs boson are
further computed. As one of the most promising channels for discovering the
model, we study the prospects for detecting the doubly-charged Higgs boson that
is produced via the vector boson fusion process and decays into final states
containing a pair of same-sign leptons at the 14-TeV LHC and a 100-TeV future
$pp$ collider. For this purpose, we evaluate acceptance times efficiency for
signals of the doubly-charged Higgs boson with general viable mass spectra and
compare it with the standard model background estimates.

"Attosecond-recollision-controlled selective fragmentation of polyatomic
  molecules","  Control over various fragmentation reactions of a series of polyatomic
molecules (acetylene, ethylene, 1,3-butadiene) by the optical waveform of
intense few-cycle laser pulses is demonstrated experimentally. We show both
experimentally and theoretically that the responsible mechanism is inelastic
ionization from inner-valence molecular orbitals by recolliding electron
wavepackets, whose recollision energy in few-cycle ionizing laser pulses
strongly depends on the optical waveform. Our work demonstrates an efficient
and selective way of pre-determining fragmentation and isomerization reactions
in polyatomic molecules on sub-femtosecond time-scales.

effects is addressed. In particular, the standard Jeans Mechanism and the
generalization in treating the Universe expansion are both analyzed when bulk
viscosity affects the first-order Newtonian dynamics. As results, the
perturbation evolution is founded to be damped by dissipative processes and the
top-down mechanism of structure fragmentation is suppressed. In such a scheme,
the value of the Jeans Mass remains unchanged also in presence of viscosity.

A conjugate gradient algorithm for the astrometric core solution of Gaia,"  The ESA space astrometry mission Gaia, planned to be launched in 2013, has
been designed to make angular measurements on a global scale with
micro-arcsecond accuracy. A key component of the data processing for Gaia is
the astrometric core solution, which must implement an efficient and accurate
numerical algorithm to solve the resulting, extremely large least-squares
problem. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is a framework that
allows to implement a range of different iterative solution schemes suitable
for a scanning astrometric satellite. In order to find a computationally
efficient and numerically accurate iteration scheme for the astrometric
solution, compatible with the AGIS framework, we study an adaptation of the
classical conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and compare it to the so-called
simple iteration (SI) scheme that was previously known to converge for this
problem, although very slowly. The different schemes are implemented within a
software test bed for AGIS known as AGISLab, which allows to define, simulate
and study scaled astrometric core solutions. After successful testing in
AGISLab, the CG scheme has been implemented also in AGIS. The two algorithms CG
and SI eventually converge to identical solutions, to within the numerical
noise (of the order of 0.00001 micro-arcsec). These solutions are independent
of the starting values (initial star catalogue), and we conclude that they are
equivalent to a rigorous least-squares estimation of the astrometric
parameters. The CG scheme converges up to a factor four faster than SI in the
tested cases, and in particular spatially correlated truncation errors are much
more efficiently damped out with the CG scheme.

"Nonlinear Fourier transforms for the sine-Gordon equation in the quarter
  plane","  The solution of the sine-Gordon equation in the quarter plane can be
expressed in terms of the solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem whose
definition involves four spectral functions $a,b,A,B$. The functions $a(k)$ and
$b(k)$ are defined via a nonlinear Fourier transform of the initial data,
whereas $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ are defined via a nonlinear Fourier transform of the
boundary values. In this paper, we provide an extensive study of these
nonlinear Fourier transforms and the associated eigenfunctions under weak
regularity and decay assumptions on the initial and boundary values. The
results can be used to determine the long-time asymptotics of the sine-Gordon
quarter-plane solution via nonlinear steepest descent techniques.

  conventions","  This work attempts to give new theoretical insights to the absence of
intermediate stages in the evolution of language. In particular, it is
developed an automata networks approach to a crucial question: how a population

the appearance of sharp transitions in the self-organization of language, it is
adopted an extremely simple model of (working) memory. At each time step,
language users simply loss part of their word-memories. Through computer
simulations of low-dimensional lattices, it appear sharp transitions at
critical values that depend on the size of the vicinities of the individuals.

Cross-Domain Sparse Coding,"  Sparse coding has shown its power as an effective data representation method.
However, up to now, all the sparse coding approaches are limited within the
single domain learning problem. In this paper, we extend the sparse coding to
cross domain learning problem, which tries to learn from a source domain to a
target domain with significant different distribution. We impose the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion to reduce the cross-domain distribution
difference of sparse codes, and also regularize the sparse codes by the class
labels of the samples from both domains to increase the discriminative ability.
The encouraging experiment results of the proposed cross-domain sparse coding
algorithm on two challenging tasks --- image classification of photograph and
oil painting domains, and multiple user spam detection --- show the advantage
of the proposed method over other cross-domain data representation methods.

"Efficiency of energy funneling in the photosystem II supercomplex of
  higher plants","  The investigation of energy transfer properties in photosynthetic
multi-protein networks gives insight into their underlying design
principles.Here, we discuss excitonic energy transfer mechanisms of the
photosystem II (PS-II) C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ supercomplex, which is the largest
isolated functional unit of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher
plants.Despite the lack of a decisive energy gradient in C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$, we
show that the energy transfer is directed by relaxation to low energy states.
C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ is not organized to form pathways with strict energetic
downhill transfer, which has direct consequences on the transfer efficiency,
transfer pathways and transfer limiting steps. The exciton dynamics is
sensitive to small structural changes, which, for instance, are induced by the
reorganization of vibrational coordinates. In order to incorporate the
reorganization process in our numerical simulations, we go beyond rate
equations and use the hierarchically coupled equation of motion approach
(HEOM). While transfer from the peripherical antenna to the proteins in
proximity to the reaction center occurs on a faster time scale, the final step
of the energy transfer to the RC core is rather slow, and thus the limiting
step in the transfer chain. Our findings suggest that the structure of the
PS-II supercomplex guarantees photoprotection rather than optimized efficiency.

"The Coulomb bridge function and the Pair-distribution functions of the
  2-dimensional electron liquid in the quantum regime","  The electron-electron pair distribution functions (PDF) of the 2-D electron
fluid (2DEF) in the quantum regime (at T=0) are calculated using a
classical-map-hyper-netted-chain (CHNC) scheme and compared with currently
available Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations in the coupling range r_s=1 to
50. We iteratively extract the bridge function of the ""equivalent"" classical
2-D liquid in the quantum regime. These bridge functions B(r) are relatively
insensitive to spin-polarization effects. The structure of the bridge functions
changes significantly for r_s>6, suggesting the onset of strongly correlated
clusters. The new B(r), appropriate for the long-range Coulomb potential, can
be used to replace the hard-sphere B(r) previously used in these calculations.
They provide accurate classical representations of the QMC-PDFs even at very
strong coupling, and probably at finite-T near T=0.

"Joint Color-Spatial-Directional clustering and Region Merging (JCSD-RM)
  for unsupervised RGB-D image segmentation","  Recent advances in depth imaging sensors provide easy access to the
synchronized depth with color, called RGB-D image. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised method for indoor RGB-D image segmentation and analysis. We
consider a statistical image generation model based on the color and geometry
of the scene. Our method consists of a joint color-spatial-directional
clustering method followed by a statistical planar region merging method. We
evaluate our method on the NYU depth database and compare it with existing
unsupervised RGB-D segmentation methods. Results show that, it is comparable
with the state of the art methods and it needs less computation time. Moreover,
it opens interesting perspectives to fuse color and geometry in an unsupervised
manner.

These are experimentally feasible as they require measurements to be performed

Contest based on a directed polymer in a random medium,"  We introduce a simple one-parameter game derived from a model describing the
properties of a directed polymer in a random medium. At his turn, each of the
two players picks a move among two alternatives in order to maximize his final
score, and minimize opponent's return. For a game of length $n$, we find that
the probability distribution of the final score $S_n$ develops a traveling wave
form, ${\rm Prob}(S_n=m)=f(m-v n)$, with the wave profile $f(z)$ unusually
decaying as a double exponential for large positive and negative $z$. In
addition, as the only parameter in the game is varied, we find a transition
where one player is able to get his maximum theoretical score. By extending
this model, we suggest that the front velocity $v$ is selected by the nonlinear
marginal stability mechanism arising in some traveling wave problems for which
the profile decays exponentially, and for which standard traveling wave theory
applies.

2-block Springer fibers: convolution algebras and coherent sheaves,"  For a fixed 2-block Springer fiber, we describe the structure of its
irreducible components and their relation to the Bialynicki-Birula paving,
following work of Fung. That is, we consider the space of complete flags in C^n
preserved by a fixed nilpotent matrix with 2 Jordan blocks, and study the
action of diagonal matrices commuting with our fixed nilpotent. In particular,
we describe the structure of each component, its set of torus fixed points, and
prove a conjecture of Fung describing the intersection of any pair.
  Then we define a convolution algebra structure on the direct sum of the
cohomologies of pairwise intersections of irreducible components and closures
of C^*-attracting sets (that is, Bialynicki-Birula cells), and show this is
isomorphic to a generalization of the arc algebra of Khovanov defined by the
first author. We investigate the connection of this algebra to Cautis &
Kamnitzer's recent work on link homology via coherent sheaves and suggest
directions for future research.

Casimir Effect in Horava-Lifshitz-like theories,"  In this paper we consider a Lorentz-breaking scalar field theory within the
Horava-Lifshtz approach. We investigate the changes that a space-time
anisotropy produces in the Casimir effect. A massless real quantum scalar field
is considered in two distinct situations: between two parallel plates and
inside a rectangular two-dimensional box. In both cases we have adopted
specific boundary conditions on the field at the boundary. As we shall see, the

Illumination by Tangent Lines,"  Let f be a differentiable function on the real line, and let P\inG_{f}^{C}=
all points not on the graph of f. We say that the illumination index of P,
denoted by I_{f}(P), is k if there are k distinct tangents to the graph of f
which pass through P. In section 2 we prove results about the illumination
index of f with f"" (x)\geq 0 on \Re. In particular, suppose that y=L_1(x) and
y=L_2(x) are distinct oblique asymptotes of f and let P=(s,t)\in G_{f}^{C}. If
max(L_1(s),L_2(s))<t<f(s), then I_{f}(P)=2. If L_1(s)\not= L_2(s) and
min(L_1(s),L_1(s))<t\leqmax(L_1(s),L_2(s)), then I_{f}(P)=1.
  Finally, if t_\leqmin(L_1(s),L_2(s)), then I_{f}(P)=0. We also show that any
point below the graph of a convex rational function or exponential polynomial
must have illumination index equal to 2. In section 3 we also prove results
about the illumination index of polynomials.

More on Gribov copies and propagators in Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory,"  Fixing a gauge in the non-perturbative domain of Yang-Mills theory is a
non-trivial problem due to the presence of Gribov copies. In particular, there
are different gauges in the non-perturbative regime which all correspond to the
same definition of a gauge in the perturbative domain. Gauge-dependent
correlation functions may differ in these gauges. Two such gauges are the
minimal and absolute Landau gauge, both corresponding to the perturbative
Landau gauge. These, and their numerical implementation, are described and
presented in detail. Other choices will also be discussed.
  This investigation is performed, using numerical lattice gauge theory
calculations, by comparing the propagators of gluons and ghosts for the minimal
Landau gauge and the absolute Landau gauge in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is
found that the propagators are different in the far infrared and even at energy
scales of the order of half a GeV. In particular, also the finite-volume
effects are modified. This is observed in two and three dimensions. Some
remarks on the four-dimensional case are provided as well.

A Review of Macroscopic Motion in Thermodynamic Equilibrium,"  A principle on the macroscopic motion of systems in thermodynamic
equilibrium, rarely discussed in texts, is reviewed: Very small but still
macroscopic parts of a fully isolated system in thermal equilibrium move as if
points of a rigid body, macroscopic energy being dissipated to increase
internal energy, and increase entropy along. It appears particularly important
in Space physics, when dissipation involves long-range fields at
Electromagnetism and Gravitation, rather than short-range contact forces. It is
shown how new physics, Special Relativity as regards Electromagnetism, first
Newtonian theory then General Relativity as regards Gravitation, determine
different dissipative processes involved in the approach to that equilibrium.

Worldsheet Description of Exotic Five-brane with Two Gauged Isometries,"  We study the string worldsheet description of the background geometry of the
exotic $5^2_2$-brane where two isometries are gauged. This is an extension of
the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) for the exotic $5^2_2$-brane with a single
gauged isometry. The new GLSM with two gauged isometries has only ${\mathcal
N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry rather than ${\mathcal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetry of the
original GLSM. This is caused by a conflict between two different $SU(2)_R$
associated with the two gauge symmetries. However, if we take a certain limit,
we can find the genuine string sigma model of the background geometry of the
exotic $5^2_2$-brane with ${\mathcal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetry. We also
investigate the worldsheet instanton corrections to the background geometry of
the exotic $5^2_2$-brane. The worldsheet instanton corrections to the string
sigma model can be traced in terms of the two gauge fields in the new GLSM.
This new GLSM gives rise to a different feature of the quantum corrections from
the one in the GLSM with the single gauged isometry.

A structural analysis of the A5/1 state transition graph,"  We describe efficient algorithms to analyze the cycle structure of the graph
induced by the state transition function of the A5/1 stream cipher used in GSM
mobile phones and report on the results of the implementation. The analysis is
performed in five steps utilizing HPC clusters, GPGPU and external memory
computation. A great reduction of this huge state transition graph of 2^64
nodes is achieved by focusing on special nodes in the first step and removing
leaf nodes that can be detected with limited effort in the second step. This
step does not break the overall structure of the graph and keeps at least one
node on every cycle. In the third step the nodes of the reduced graph are
connected by weighted edges. Since the number of nodes is still huge an
efficient bitslice approach is presented that is implemented with NVIDIA's CUDA
framework and executed on several GPUs concurrently. An external memory
algorithm based on the STXXL library and its parallel pipelining feature
further reduces the graph in the fourth step. The result is a graph containing
only cycles that can be further analyzed in internal memory to count the number
and size of the cycles. This full analysis which previously would take months
can now be completed within a few days and allows to present structural results
for the full graph for the first time. The structure of the A5/1 graph deviates
notably from the theoretical results for random mappings.

used to describe the elastic scattering. 4He is taken as spherical and
inelastic couplings to the first excited states of 6He and 12C are described
with collective rotational model and coupled-channels method. Deformation
lengths for 6He and 12C are determined from semi-classical nuclear level
density model by using Laplace-like formula for the nuclear level density
parameter. The comparison of the predicted and the measured cross sections are
presented to test the applicability of nuclear level density model to the light
exotic nuclei reactions. Good agreement is achieved between the predicted and

Cluster tilting for higher Auslander algebras,"  The concept of cluster tilting gives a higher analogue of classical Auslander
correspondence between representation-finite algebras and Auslander algebras.
The $n$-Auslander-Reiten translation functor $\tau_n$ plays an important role
in the study of $n$-cluster tilting subcategories. We study the category
$\MM_n$ of preinjective-like modules obtained by applying $\tau_n$ to injective
modules repeatedly. We call a finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$
\emph{$n$-complete} if $\MM_n=\add M$ for an $n$-cluster tilting object $M$.
Our main result asserts that the endomorphism algebra $\End_\Lambda(M)$ is
$(n+1)$-complete. This gives an inductive construction of $n$-complete
algebras. For example, any representation-finite hereditary algebra
$\Lambda^{(1)}$ is 1-complete. Hence the Auslander algebra $\Lambda^{(2)}$ of
$\Lambda^{(1)}$ is 2-complete. Moreover, for any $n\ge1$, we have an
$n$-complete algebra $\Lambda^{(n)}$ which has an $n$-cluster tilting object
$M^{(n)}$ such that $\Lambda^{(n+1)}=\End_{\Lambda^{(n)}}(M^{(n)})$. We give
the presentation of $\Lambda^{(n)}$ by a quiver with relations. We apply our
results to construct $n$-cluster tilting subcategories of derived categories of
$n$-complete algebras.

"The astronomical garden of Venus and Mars-NG915: the pivotal role of
  Astronomy in dating and deciphering Botticelli's masterpiece","  This essay demonstrates the key role of Astronomy in Botticelli's ""Venus and
Mars-NG915"" painting, to date only very partially understood. Worthwhile
coincidences among the principles of the Ficinian philosophy, the historical
characters involved and the compositional elements of the painting, show how
the astronomical knowledge of that time strongly influenced this masterpiece.
First, Astronomy provides its precise dating since the artist used the
astronomical ephemerides of his time, albeit preserving a mythological meaning,
and a clue for Botticelli's signature. Second, it allows the correlation among
Botticelli's creative intention, the historical facts and the astronomical
phenomena such as the heliacal rising of the planet Venus in conjunction with
the Aquarius constellation dating back to the earliest representations of Venus
in Mesopotamian culture. This work not only bears a significant value for the
history of science and art, but, in the current era of three-dimensional
mapping of billion stars about to be delivered by Gaia, states the role of
astronomical heritage in Western culture. Finally, following the same method, a
precise astronomical dating for the famous Primavera painting is suggested.

"Three-point phase correlations: A new measure of non-linear large-scale
  structure","  We derive an analytical expression for a novel large-scale structure
observable: the line correlation function. The line correlation function, which
is constructed from the three-point correlation function of the phase of the
density field, is a robust statistical measure allowing the extraction of
information in the non-linear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in
perturbation theory, the line correlation is sensitive to the coupling kernel
F_2, which governs the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field.
We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations
and find a 1-sigma agreement for separations r<30 Mpc/h. Fitting formulae for
the power spectrum and the non-linear coupling kernel at small scales allow us
to extend our prediction into the strongly non-linear regime where we find a
1-sigma agreement with the simulations for r<2 Mpc/h. We discuss the advantages
of the line correlation relative to standard statistical measures like the
bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the line correlation is independent of the bias,
in the regime where the bias is local and linear. Furthermore, the variance of
the line correlation is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of
the density field. This suggests that the line correlation can probe more
precisely the non-linear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the
power spectrum variance.

Geographic constraints on social network groups,"  Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our
social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been
impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this
restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of
individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also
classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection
algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of
varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and
geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are
geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size
exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological
positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities.
These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and
spatial constraints.

"Evolution of the dust emission of massive galaxies up to z=4 and
  constraints on their dominant mode of star formation","  We aim to measure the average dust and molecular gas content of massive
star-forming galaxies ($\rm > 3 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$) up to z=4 in the
COSMOS field to determine if the intense star formation observed at high
redshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.
Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions
as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel,
LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects
and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We
found that the mean intensity of the radiation field $< U >$ heating the dust
(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift
up to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with
simple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity with
redshift. No evolution of $< U >$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.
We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as
$\rm M_{\rm mol}/(M_{\rm mol}+M_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,
steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches
$\sim$60%. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus
of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt
diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the
bulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

Correlating correlation functions of primordial perturbations,"  We explore the correlations between correlation functions of the primordial
curvature perturbation produced during inflation. We find that for general

details, higher order correlation functions are characterized by the power
spectrum, its spectral index and running. The correlation between the
bispectrum and power spectrum is presented as an explicit example of our
systematic approach.

Higher Order City Voronoi Diagrams,"  We investigate higher-order Voronoi diagrams in the city metric. This metric
is induced by quickest paths in the L1 metric in the presence of an
accelerating transportation network of axis-parallel line segments. For the
structural complexity of kth-order city Voronoi diagrams of n point sites, we
show an upper bound of O(k(n - k) + kc) and a lower bound of {\Omega}(n + kc),
where c is the complexity of the transportation network. This is quite
different from the bound O(k(n - k)) in the Euclidean metric. For the special
case where k = n - 1 the complexity in the Euclidean metric is O(n), while that
in the city metric is {\Theta}(nc).
  Furthermore, we develop an O(k^2(n + c) log n)-time iterative algorithm to
compute the kth-order city Voronoi diagram and an O(nc log^2(n + c) log n)-time
divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the farthest-site city Voronoi diagram.

thermoelectrical responses. When the Kondo correlations prevail over the
antiferromagnetic coupling $J$ between dot spins we demonstrate that the setup
shows negative differential thermal conductance regions behaving as a thermal
diode. Besides, we report a sign reversal of the thermoelectric current
$I(\theta)$ controlled by $t/\Gamma$ ($t$ and $\Gamma$ denote the interdot
tunnel and reservoir-dot tunnel couplings, respectively) and $\theta$. All
these features are attributed to the fact that at large $\theta$, both
$Q(\theta)$ (heat current) and $I(\theta)$ are suppressed regardless the value
of $t/\Gamma$ because the double dot decouples at high thermal biases.
Eventually, and for a finite $J$, we investigate how the
Kondo-to-antiferromagnetic crossover is altered by $\theta$.

"Do scale-invariant fluctuations imply the breaking of de Sitter
  invariance?","  The quantization of the massless minimally coupled (mmc) scalar field in de
Sitter spacetime is known to be a non-trivial problem due to the appearance of
strong infrared (IR) effects. In particular, the scale-invariance of the CMB
power-spectrum - certainly one of the most successful predictions of modern
cosmology - is widely believed to be inconsistent with a de Sitter invariant
mmc two-point function.
  Using a Cesaro-summability technique to properly define an otherwise
divergent Fourier transform, we show in this Letter that de Sitter symmetry
breaking is \emph{not} a necessary consequence of the scale-invariant
fluctuation spectrum. We also generalize our result to the tachyonic scalar
fields, i.e the discrete series of representations of the de Sitter group, that
suffer from similar strong IR effects.

An Explicit Construction of Gauss-Jordan Elimination Matrix,"  A constructive approach to get the reduced row echelon form of a given matrix
$A$ is presented. It has been shown that after the $k$th step of the
Gauss-Jordan procedure, each entry $a^k_{ij}(i<>j; j > k)$ in the new matrix
$A^k$ can always be expressed as a ratio of two determinants whose entries are
from the original matrix $A$. The new method also gives a more general
generalization of Cramer's rule than existing methods.

Non null controllability of the Grushin equation in 2D,"  We are interested in the exact null controllability of the equation
$\partial_t f - \partial_x^2 f - x^2 \partial_y^2f = \mathbf 1_\omega u$, with
control $u$ supported on $\omega$. We show that, when $\omega$ does not
intersect a horizontal band, the considered equation is never
null-controllable. The main idea is to interpret the associated observability
inequality as an $L^2$ estimate on entire functions, which Runge's theorem
disproves. To that end, we study in particular the first eigenvalue of the
operator $-\partial_x^2 + (nx)^2$ with Dirichlet conditions on $(-1,1)$ and we
show a quite precise estimation it satisfies, even when $n$ is in some complex
domain.

Hidden Conformal Symmetry of the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m Black Holes,"  Motivated by recent progresses in the holographic descriptions of the Kerr
and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m (RN) black holes, we explore the hidden conformal
symmetry of nonextremal uplifted 5D RN black hole by studying the near horizon
wave equation of a massless scalar field propagating in this background.
Similar to the Kerr black hole case, this hidden symmetry is broken by the
periodicity of the associated angle coordinate in the background geometry, but
the results somehow testify the dual CFT description of the nonextremal RN
black holes. The duality is further supported by matching of the entropies and
absorption cross sections calculated from both CFT and gravity sides.

"Very fast photometric and X-ray observations of the intermediate polar
  V2069 Cygni (RX J2123.7+4217)","  We present fast timing photometric observations of the intermediate polar
V2069 Cygni (RX J2123.7+4217) using the Optical Timing Analyzer (OPTIMA) at the
1.3 m telescope of Skinakas Observatory. The optical (450-950 nm) light curve
of V2069 Cygni was measured with sub-second resolution for the first time
during July 2009 and revealed a double-peaked pulsation with a period of 743.38
+0.25. A similar double-peaked modulation was found in the simultaneous Swift
satellite observations. We suggest that this period represents the spin of the
white dwarf accretor. Moreover, we present the results from a detailed analysis
of the XMM-Newton observation that also shows a double-peaked modulation,
however shifted in phase, with 742.35 +0.23 s period. The X-ray spectra
obtained from the XMM-Newton EPIC (European Photon Imaging Camera) instruments
were modelled by a plasma emission and a soft black body component with a
partial covering photo-electric absorption model with covering fraction of
0.65. An additional Gaussian emission line at 6.385 keV with an equivalent
width of 243 eV is required to account for fluorescent emission from neutral
iron. The iron fluorescence (~6.4 keV) and FeXXVI lines (~6.95 keV) are clearly
resolved in the EPIC spectra. In the Porb-Pspin diagram of IPs, V2069 Cyg shows
a low spin to orbit ratio of ~0.0276 in comparison with ~0.1 for other
intermediate polars.

"Spectrum and Franck-Condon factors of interacting suspended single-wall
  carbon nanotubes","  A low energy theory of suspended carbon nanotube quantum dots in weak
tunnelling coupling with metallic leads is presented. The focus is put on the
dependence of the spectrum and the Franck-Condon factors on the geometry of the
junction including several vibronic modes. The relative size and the relative
position of the dot and its associated vibrons strongly influence the
electromechanical properties of the system. A detailed analysis of the complete
parameters space reveals different regimes: in the short vibron regime the
tunnelling of an electron into the nanotube generates a plasmon-vibron
excitation while in the long vibron regime polaron excitations dominate the
scenario. The small, position dependent Franck-Condon couplings of the small
vibron regime convert into uniform, large couplings in the long vibron regime.
Selection rules for the excitations of the different plasmon-vibron modes via
electronic tunnelling events are also derived.

"Non-supersymmetric D1/D5, F/NS5 and closed string tachyon condensation","  We construct the intersecting non-supersymmetric (non-susy) D1/D5 solution of
type IIB string theory. While, as usual, the solution is charged under an
electric two-form and an electric six-form gauge field, it also contains a
non-susy chargeless (non-BPS) D0-brane. The S-dual of this solution is the
non-susy F/NS5 solution. We show how these solutions nicely interpolate between
the corresponding black (or non-extremal) solutions and the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
""bubble of nothing"" (BON) by continuously changing some parameters
characterizing the solutions from one set of values to another. We show, by a
time symmetric general bubble initial data analysis, that the final bubbles in
these cases are static and stable and the interpolations can be physically
interpreted as closed string tachyon condensation. As special cases, we recover
the transition of two charge black F-string to BON, considered by Horowitz, and
also the transition from AdS$_3$ black hole to global AdS$_3$.

Power spectrum of electronic heat current fluctuations,"  We analyze the fluctuations of an electronic thermal current across an
idealized molecular junction. The focus here will be on the spectral features
of the resulting heat fluctuations. By use of the Green functionmethod we
derive an explicit expression for the frequency-dependent power spectral
density of the emerging energy fluctuations. The complex expression simplifies
considerably in the limit of zero frequency, yielding the noise intensity of
the heat current. The spectral density for the electronic heat fluctuations
still depends on the frequency in the zero-temperature limit, assuming
different asymptotic behaviours in the low- and high-frequency regions. We
further address subtleties and open problems from an experimental viewpoint for
measurements of frequency-dependent power spectral densities.

"Aggregation of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic atoms at edges of
  graphenes and graphite","  In this work, we report that when ferromagnetic metals (Fe, Co and Ni) are
thermally evaporated onto n-layer graphenes and graphite, a metal nanowire and
adjacent nanogaps can be found along the edges regardless of its zigzag or
armchair structure. Similar features can also be observed for paramagnetic
metals, such as Mn, Al and Pd. Meanwhile, metal nanowires and adjacent nanogaps
can not be found for diamagnetic metals (Au and Ag). An external magnetic field
during the evaporation of metals can make these unique features disappear for
ferromagnetic and paramagnetic metal; and the morphologies of diamagnetic metal
do not change after the application of an external magnetic field. We discuss
the possible reasons for these novel and interesting results, which include
possible one dimensional ferromagnets along the edge and edge-related binding
energy.

"Reducing the Computational Complexity of Multicasting in Large-Scale
  Antenna Systems","  In this paper, we study the physical layer multicasting to multiple
co-channel groups in large-scale antenna systems. The users within each group
are interested in a common message and different groups have distinct messages.
In particular, we aim at designing the precoding vectors solving the so-called
quality of service (QoS) and weighted max-min fairness (MMF) problems, assuming
that the channel state information is available at the base station (BS). To
solve both problems, the baseline approach exploits the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique. Considering a BS with $N$ antennas, the SDR complexity is more
than $\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$, which prevents its application in large-scale
antenna systems. To overcome this issue, we present two new classes of
algorithms that, not only have significantly lower computational complexity
than existing solutions, but also largely outperform the SDR based methods.
Moreover, we present a novel duality between transformed versions of the QoS
and the weighted MMF problems. The duality explicitly determines the solution
to the weighted MMF problem given the solution to the QoS problem, and vice
versa. Numerical results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions and to make comparisons with existing alternatives under different
operating conditions.

Delay Optimal Secrecy in Two-Relay Network,"  We consider a two-relay network in which a source aims to communicate a
confidential message to a destination while keeping the message secret from the
relay nodes. In the first hop, the channels from the source to the relays are
assumed to be block-fading and the channel states change arbitrarily -possibly
non-stationary and non-ergodic- across blocks. When the relay feedback on the
states of the source-to-relay channels is available on the source with no
delay, we provide an encoding strategy to achieve the optimal delay. We next
consider the case in which there is one-block delayed relay feedback on the
states of the source-to-relay channels. We show that for a set of channel state
sequences, the optimal delay with one-block delayed feedback differs from the
optimal delay with no-delayed feedback at most one block.

of every planar partial 3-tree and also every plane partial 3-tree is at most

The Silver Lining Around Fearful Living,"  This paper discusses in layperson's terms human and computational studies of
the impact of threat and fear on exploration and creativity. A first study
showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without
predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of
new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve. However, for the
fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take
longer. This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior
varying only one parameter, the fear parameter. A second study showed that
stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than
stories inspired by non-threatening photographs. Various explanations for the
findings are discussed.

"Ferromagnetic resonance force spectroscopy of individual sub-micron size
  samples","  We review how a magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM) can be applied to
perform ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy of \emph{individual}
sub-micron size samples. We restrict our attention to a thorough study of the
spin-wave eigen-modes excited in permalloy (Py) disks patterned out of the same
43.3 nm thin film. The disks have a diameter of either 1.0 or $0.5 \mu$m and
are quasi-saturated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field. It is shown
that \emph{quantitative} spectroscopic information can be extracted from the
MRFM measurements. In particular, the data are extensively compared with
complementary approximate models of the dynamical susceptibility: i) a 2D
analytical model, which assumes an homogeneous magnetization dynamics along the
thickness and ii) a full 3D micromagnetic simulation, which assumes an
homogeneous magnetization dynamics below a characteristic length scale $c$ and
which approximates the cylindrical sample volume by a discretized
representation with regular cubic mesh of lateral size $c=3.9$ nm. In our
analysis, the distortions due to a breaking of the axial symmetry are taken
into account, both models incorporating the possibility of a small misalignment
between the applied field and the normal of the disks.

Direct Evidence of Metallic Bands in a Monolayer Boron Sheet,"  The search for metallic boron allotropes has attracted great attention in the

in monolayer boron. Here, we synthesize the \b{eta}12-sheet monolayer boron on

using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The Fermi surface is composed
of one electron pocket at the S point and a pair of hole pockets near the X
point, which is supported by the first-principles calculations. The metallic
boron allotrope in \b{eta}12 sheet opens the way to novel physics and chemistry
in material science.

The extraction of parameters from final state interactions,"  It is argued that final state enhancements in production reactions at large
momentum transfers, such as pp -> K^+ Lambda p, are primarily sensitive to the
position of a virtual bound state pole in the Lambda p system rather than the
Lambda p scattering length and effective range. These arguments are supported
by a study of the dispersion relation derived to describe such processes as a
function of the cut-off energy. This shows that the position of the virtual
bound state is independent of the cut-off energy.

Leverage and Uncertainty,"  Risk and uncertainty will always be a matter of experience, luck, skills, and
modelling. Leverage is another concept, which is critical for the investor
decisions and results. Adaptive skills and quantitative probabilistic methods
need to be used in successful management of risk, uncertainty and leverage. The
author explores how uncertainty beyond risk determines consistent leverage in a
simple model of the world with fat tails due to significant, not fully
quantifiable and not too rare events. Among particular technical results, for
the single asset fractional Kelly criterion is derived in the presence of the
fat tails associated with subjective uncertainty. For the multi-asset

"Quantum Hall Effect from the Topological Surface States of Strained Bulk
  HgTe","  We report transport studies on a three dimensional, 70 nm thick HgTe layer,
which is strained by epitaxial growth on a CdTe substrate. The strain induces a
band gap in the otherwise semi-metallic HgTe, which thus becomes a three
dimensional topological insulator. Contributions from residual bulk carriers to
the transport properties of the gapped HgTe layer are negligible at mK
temperatures. As a result, the sample exhibits a quantized Hall effect that
results from the 2D single cone Dirac-like topological surface states.

Quench action and Renyi entropies in integrable systems,"  Entropy is a fundamental concept in equilibrium statistical mechanics, yet
its origin in the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems is not
fully understood. A strong consensus is emerging around the idea that the
stationary thermodynamic entropy is the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a
large subsystem embedded in an infinite system. Also motivated by cold-atom
experiments, here we consider the generalisation to Renyi entropies. We develop
a new technique to calculate the diagonal Renyi entropy in the quench action
formalism. In the spirit of the replica treatment for the entanglement entropy,
the diagonal Renyi entropies are generalised free energies evaluated over a
thermodynamic macrostate which depends on the Renyi index and, in particular,
it is not the same describing the von Neumann entropy. The technical reason for
this, maybe surprising, result is that the evaluation of the moments of the
diagonal density matrix shifts the saddle point of the quench action. An
interesting consequence is that different Renyi entropies encode information
about different regions of the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian. Our
approach provides a very simple proof of the long-standing issue that, for
integrable systems, the diagonal entropy is half of the thermodynamic one and
it allows us to generalise this result to the case of arbitrary Renyi entropy.

"Mechanical properties and microdomain separation of fluid membranes with
  anchored polymers","  The entropic effects of anchored polymers on biomembranes are studied using
simulations of a meshless membrane model combined with anchored linear polymer
chains. The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for
anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains. Our results are in good
agreement with the previous theoretical predictions. It is found that the
polymer reduces the line tension of membrane edges, as well as the interfacial
line tension between membrane domains, leading to microdomain formation.
Instead of the mixing of two phases as observed in typical binary fluids,
densely anchored polymers stabilize small domains. A mean field theory is
proposed for the edge line tension reduced by anchored ideal chains, which
reproduces our simulation results well.

"Lightweight Monte Carlo Verification of Markov Decision Processes with
  Rewards","  Markov decision processes are useful models of concurrency optimisation
problems, but are often intractable for exhaustive verification methods. Recent
work has introduced lightweight approximative techniques that sample directly
from scheduler space, bringing the prospect of scalable alternatives to
standard numerical model checking algorithms. The focus so far has been on
optimising the probability of a property, but many problems require
quantitative analysis of rewards. In this work we therefore present lightweight
statistical model checking algorithms to optimise the rewards of Markov
decision processes. We consider the standard definitions of rewards used in
model checking, introducing an auxiliary hypothesis test to accommodate
reachability rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on a
number of standard case studies.

Did GW150914 produce a rotating gravastar?,"  The interferometric LIGO detectors have recently measured the first direct
gravitational-wave signal from what has been interpreted as the inspiral,
merger and ringdown of a binary system of black holes. The signal-to-noise
ratio of the measured signal is large enough to leave little doubt that it does
refer to the inspiral of two massive and ultracompact objects, whose merger
yields a rotating black hole. Yet, the quality of the data is such that some
room is left for alternative interpretations that do not involve black holes,
but other objects that, within classical general relativity, can be equally
massive and compact, namely, gravastars. We here consider the hypothesis that
the merging objects were indeed gravastars and explore whether the merged
object could therefore be not a black hole but a rotating gravastar. After
comparing the real and imaginary parts of the ringdown signal of GW150914 with
the corresponding quantities for a variety of gravastars, and notwithstanding
the very limited knowledge of the perturbative response of rotating gravastars,
we conclude it is not possible to model the measured ringdown of GW150914 as
due to a rotating gravastar.

"Improved Pseudolikelihood Regularization and Decimation methods on
  Non-linearly Interacting Systems with Continuous Variables","  We propose and test improvements to state-of-the-art techniques of Bayeasian
statistical inference based on pseudolikelihood maximization with $\ell_1$
regularization and with decimation. In particular, we present a method to
determine the best value of the regularizer parameter starting from a
hypothesis testing technique. Concerning the decimation, we also analyze the
worst case scenario in which there is no sharp peak in the
tilded-pseudolikelihood function, firstly defined as a criterion to stop the
decimation. Techniques are applied to noisy systems with non-linear dynamics,
mapped onto multi-variable interacting Hamiltonian effective models for waves
and phasors. Results are analyzed varying the number of available samples and
the externally tunable temperature-like parameter mimicing real data noise.
Eventually the behavior of inference procedures described are tested against a
wrong hypothesis: non-linearly generated data are analyzed with a pairwise
interacting hypothesis. Our analysis shows that, looking at the behavior of the
inverse graphical problem as data size increases, the methods exposed allow to
rule out a wrong hypothesis.

Inter-relationship between the Two Emission Cones of B1237+25,"  The origin of two distinct pairs of conal emission components in pulsars,
associated with the ""outer"" and the ""inner"" emission cones, as well as the
marked difference in their observed spectral properties, is poorly understood.
The sub-pulse modulation in the corresponding conal components, if mapped back
to the underlying system of sub-beams rotating around the magnetic axis in the
polar cap, as envisioned by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975), provides a potential
way to investigate the emission morphologies in the two conal regions, and more
importantly, any inter-relationship between them. The bright pulsar B1237+25
with its special viewing geometry where the sightline traverses almost through
the magnetic axis, along with a rich variety in pulse-to-pulse fluctuations,
provides an excellent, but challenging opportunity to map the underlying
emission patterns across the full transverse slice of its polar emission
region. We present here our analysis on a number of pulse-sequences from this
star to map and study any relationship between the underlying patterns
responsible for emission in the two pairs of presumed conal-components and a
core-component of this pulsar. The results from our correlation analysis of the
two conal emission patterns strongly support the view that the two cones of
this pulsar (the outer and the inner cone) originate from a common system of
sub-beams. We also see evidence for a twist in the emission columns, most
likely associated with a corresponding twist in the magnetic field structure.
We discuss these results, and their implications, including a possibility that
the core component of this pulsar shares its origin partly with the conal
counterparts.

Noncommutative Plurisubharmonic Polynomials Part I: Global Assumptions,"  We consider symmetric polynomials, p, in the noncommutative free variables
(x_1, x_2, ..., x_g). We define the noncommutative complex hessian of p and we
call a noncommutative symmetric polynomial noncommutative plurisubharmonic if
it has a noncommutative complex hessian that is positive semidefinite when
evaluated on all tuples of n x n matrices for every size n. In this paper, we
show that the symmetric noncommutative plurisubharmonic polynomials are
precisely the noncommutative convex polynomials with a noncommutative analytic
change of variables; i.e., a noncommutative symmetric polynomial, p, is
noncommutative plurisubharmonic if and only if it has the form p = \sum f_j^T
f_j + \sum k_j k_j^T + F + F^T where the sums are finite and f_j, k_j, F are
all noncommutative analytic. We also present a theory of noncommutative
integration for noncommutative polynomials and we prove a noncommutative
version of the Frobenius theorem. A subsequent paper by Greene proves that if
the noncommutative complex hessian of p takes positive semidefinite values on a
""noncommutative open set"" then the noncommutative complex hessian takes
positive semidefinite values on all matrix tuples. Thus, p has the form above.
The proof in the subsequent paper draws on most of the theorems in this paper
together with a very different technique involving representations of
noncommutative quadratic functions.

"An iterative aggregation and disaggregation approach to the calculation
  of steady-state distributions of continuous processes","  A mapping of the process on a continuous configuration space to the symbolic
representation of the motion on a discrete state space will be combined with an
iterative aggregation and disaggregation (IAD) procedure to obtain steady state
distributions of the process. The IAD speeds up the convergence to the unit
eigenvector, which is the steady state distribution, by forming smaller
aggregated matrices whose unit eigenvector solutions are used to refine
approximations of the steady state vector until convergence is reached. This
method works very efficiently and can be used together with distributed or
parallel computing methods to obtain high resolution images of the steady state
distribution of complex atomistic or energy landscape type problems. The method
is illustrated in two numerical examples. In the first example the transition
matrix is assumed to be known. The second example represents an overdamped
Brownian motion process subject to a dichotomously changing external potential.

"Evidence of density waves in single crystalline nanowires of Pyrochlore
  Iridates","  We present experimental evidence of emergent density wave instability in
single crystalline low dimensional wires of Yittrium based Pyrochlore Iridates.
We demonstrate electric field induced nonlinear hysteretic switching of the
density wave at low temperature, followed by smooth nonlinear conduction at
higher temperature (T > 40 K) in $Y_{2-x}Bi_{x}Ir_{2}O_{7}$ with x = 0 and 0.3.
AC transport measurements reveal the presence of four different collective
relaxation processes which dominate at different temperature scales. There is a
strong coupling of the normal charge carriers with the density wave condensate,
which is reflected in the linear scaling of the dc conductivity with the
collective relaxation rate across a wide range of frequency and temperature
regime. The evidence of density wave in low dimensional single crystals of
Pyrochlore Iridate could be a precursor to the possible experimental
confirmation of the Weyl semimetallic ground state with broken chiral symmetry.

Stokes flow near the contact line of an evaporating drop,"  The evaporation of sessile drops in quiescent air is usually governed by
vapour diffusion. For contact angles below $90^\circ$, the evaporative flux
from the droplet tends to diverge in the vicinity of the contact line.
Therefore, the description of the flow inside an evaporating drop has remained
a challenge. Here, we focus on the asymptotic behaviour near the pinned contact
line, by analytically solving the Stokes equations in a wedge geometry of
arbitrary contact angle. The flow field is described by similarity solutions,
with exponents that match the singular boundary condition due to evaporation.
We demonstrate that there are three contributions to the flow in a wedge: the
evaporative flux, the downward motion of the liquid-air interface and the
eigenmode solution which fulfils the homogeneous boundary conditions. Below a
critical contact angle of $133.4^\circ$, the evaporative flux solution will
dominate, while above this angle the eigenmode solution dominates. We
demonstrate that for small contact angles, the velocity field is very
accurately described by the lubrication approximation. For larger contact
angles, the flow separates into regions where the flow is reversing towards the
drop centre.

"Exploiting Active Subspaces in Global Optimization: How Complex is your
  Problem?","  When applying optimization method to a real-world problem, the possession of
prior knowledge and preliminary analysis on the landscape of a global
optimization problem can give us an insight into the complexity of the problem.
This knowledge can better inform us in deciding what optimization method should
be used to tackle the problem. However, this analysis becomes problematic when
the dimensionality of the problem is high. This paper presents a framework to
take a deeper look at the global optimization problem to be tackled: by
analyzing the low-dimensional representation of the problem through discovering
the active subspaces of the given problem. The virtue of this is that the
problem's complexity can be visualized in a one or two-dimensional plot, thus
allow one to get a better grip about the problem's difficulty. One could then
have a better idea regarding the complexity of their problem to determine the
choice of global optimizer or what surrogate-model type to be used.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate how the active subspaces can be used to
perform design exploration and analysis.

"On some classical problems concerning $L_{\infty}$-extremal polynomials
  with constraints","  First we consider the following problem which dates back to Chebyshev,
  Zolotarev and Achieser: among all trigonometric polynomials with given
leading coefficients $a_0,...,a_l,$ $b_0,...,b_l \in \mathbb R$ find that one
with least maximum norm on $[0,2 \pi].$ We show that the minimal polynomial is
on $[0,2 \pi]$ asymptotically equal to a Blaschke product times a constant
where the constant is the greatest singular value of the Hankel matrix
associated with the $\tau_j = a_j + i b_j.$ As a special case corresponding
statements for algebraic polynomials follow. Finally the minimal norm of
certain linear functionals on the space of trigonometric polynomials is
determined. As a consequence a conjecture by Clenshaw from the sixties on the
behavior of the ratio of the truncated Fourier series and the minimum deviation
is proved.

one single state (supercritical fluid). On the other hand, we show here that
liquids in this region exist in two qualitatively different states: ""rigid"" and
""non-rigid"" liquid. Rigid to non-rigid transition corresponds to the condition
{\tau} ~ {\tau}0, where {\tau}is liquid relaxation time and {\tau}0 is the
minimal period of transverse quasi-harmonic waves. This condition defines a new
dynamic line on the phase diagram, and corresponds to the loss of shear
stiffness of a liquid at all available frequencies, and consequently to the
qualitative change of many important liquid properties. We analyze the dynamic
line theoretically as well as in real and model liquids, and show that the
transition corresponds to the disappearance of high-frequency sound,
qualitative changes of diffusion and viscous flow, increase of particle thermal
speed to half of the speed of sound and reduction of the constant volume
specific heat to 2kB per particle. In contrast to the Widom line that exists
near the critical point only, the new dynamic line is universal: it separates
two liquid states at arbitrarily high pressure and temperature, and exists in
systems where liquid - gas transition and the critical point are absent
overall.

"Impact of Grain Boundaries on Efficiency and Stability of
  Organic-Inorganic Trihalide Perovskites","  Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous attention
because of their remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). To
further improve the device performance, however, it is imperative to obtain
fundamental understandings on the photo-response and long-term stability down
to the microscopic level. Here, we report the first quantitative nanoscale
photoconductivity imaging on two methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) thin
films with different PCEs by light-stimulated microwave impedance microscopy.
The intrinsic photo-response is largely uniform across grains and grain
boundaries, which is direct evidence on the inherently benign nature of
microstructures in the perovskite thin films. In contrast, the carrier mobility
and lifetime are strongly affected by bulk properties such as the sample
crystallinity. As visualized by the spatial evolution of local
photoconductivity, the degradation due to water diffusion through the capping
layer begins with the disintegration of large grains rather than the nucleation
and propagation from grain boundaries. Our findings provide new insights to
improve the electro-optical properties of MAPbI3 thin films towards large-scale
commercialization.

machine (CMM) a robot workstation for the positioning of measuring objects was
created. The application of a simple 5-axis industrial robot enables the

different surfaces on the same object without human intervention. In this
article an upgrade of an existing robot workstation through different design
measures is shown. The main goal of this upgrade is to improve the measuring
accuracy of the complex robot-CMM system.

"Density Estimation in Uncertainty Propagation Problems Using a Surrogate
  Model","  The effect of uncertainties and noise on a quantity of interest (model
output) is often better described by its probability density function (PDF)
than by its moments. Although density estimation is a common task, the adequacy
of approximation methods (surrogate models) for density estimation has not been
analyzed before in the uncertainty-quantification (UQ) literature. In this
paper, we first show that standard surrogate models (such as generalized
polynomial chaos), which are highly accurate for moment estimation, might
completely fail to approximate the PDF, even for one-dimensional noise. This is
because density estimation requires that the surrogate model accurately
approximates the gradient of the quantity of interest, and not just the
quantity of interest itself. Hence, we develop a novel spline-based algorithm
for density-estimation whose convergence rate in $L^q$ is polynomial in the
sampling resolution. This convergence rate is better than that of standard
statistical density-estimation methods (such as histograms and kernel density
estimators) at dimensions $1 \leq d\leq \frac{5}{2}m$, where $m$ is the spline
order. Furthermore, we obtain the convergence rate for density estimation with
any surrogate model that approximates the quantity of interest and its gradient
in $L^{\infty}$. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm for problems in
nonlinear optics and fluid dynamics.

Small-Time Asymptotics of Option Prices and First Absolute Moments,"  We study the leading term in the small-time asymptotics of at-the-money call
option prices when the stock price process $S$ follows a general martingale.
This is equivalent to studying the first centered absolute moment of $S$. We
show that if $S$ has a continuous part, the leading term is of order $\sqrt{T}$
in time $T$ and depends only on the initial value of the volatility.
Furthermore, the term is linear in $T$ if and only if $S$ is of finite
variation. The leading terms for pure-jump processes with infinite variation
are between these two cases; we obtain their exact form for stable-like small
jumps. To derive these results, we use a natural approximation of $S$ so that
calculations are necessary only for the class of L\'evy processes.

Retrolensing by a wormhole at deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$,"  The deflection angle of a light ray can be arbitrarily large near a light
sphere. The time-symmetrical shape of light curves of a pair of light rays
reflected by a light sphere of a lens object does not depend on the details of
the lens object. We consider retrolensing light curves of sunlight with
deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$ by an Ellis wormhole, which is the simplest
Morris-Thorne wormhole. If an Ellis wormhole with a throat parameter
$a=10^{11}$ km is $100$ pc away from an observer and if the Ellis wormhole, the
observer, and the sun are aligned perfectly in this order, the apparent
magnitudes of a pair of light rays with deflection angles $\pi$ and $3\pi$
become $11$ and $18$, respectively. The two pairs of light rays make a
superposed light curve with two separable peaks and they break down time
symmetry of a retrolensing light curve. The observation of the two separated
peaks of the light curves gives us information on the details of the lens
object. If the observer can also separate the pair of the images with the
deflection angle $\pi$ into a double image, he or she can say whether the
retrolensing is caused by an Ellis wormhole or a Schwarzschild black hole.

"Piecewise Linearity of Approximate Density Functionals Revisited:
  Implications for Frontier Orbital Energies","  In the exact Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), the total energy
versus the number of electrons is a series of linear segments between integer
points. However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total
energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the
ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the
ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise-linearity of an arbitrary
approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the
ensemble generalization of DFT. Furthermore, the resulting formulation
introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate
exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density-dependent.
This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron
affinity even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances
are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying
functional form. The power of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark systems
using the local density approximation as an illustrative example.

Progress on four flavor QCD with the HISQ action,"  We describe recent progress on generation of gauge configurations using the
Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action that was designed by the
HPQCD/UKQCD collaboration. The HISQ action requires two levels of smearing with
a reunitarization of the links before the second smearing. We describe how we
deal with the occurrence of occasional large forces arising from the
reunitarization step. The MILC collaboration is currently generating ensembles
with approximate lattice spacings of 0.15, 0.12, 0.09, and 0.06 fm, with the
strange and charm quark masses close to their physical values and the mass of
the light quarks m_l set to 0.2 m_s. We present recent results for pion taste
splittings, light hadron masses, the static potential, the eta_c dispersion
relation and the topological susceptibility.

particle scattered off a dynamical target that occupies a compact region in
position space. After taking a trace over the degrees of freedom of the target,
the dynamics of the particle is generated by a Lindbladian acting on the space
of trace-class operators. We study scattering theory for a general class of
Lindbladians with bounded interaction terms. First, we consider models where a
particle approaching the target is always re-emitted by the target. Then we
study models where the particle may be captured by the target. An important
ingredient of our analysis is a scattering theory for dissipative operators on
Hilbert space.

Radiative generation of the Higgs potential,"  We consider the minimal extension of the Standard Model with a generalized
B-L gauge symmetry U(1)_X for generating the Higgs potential radiatively.
Assuming that the full scalar potential vanishes at the vacuum instability
scale, we achieve the goal in terms of two free parameters, the X gauge
coupling and the right-handed neutrino Yukawa coupling. The X gauge symmetry is
broken spontaneously by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism while the scale symmetry
breakdown induces electroweak symmetry breaking through the radiative
generation of appropriate scalar quartic couplings. We show that there is a
reasonable parameter space that is consistent with a correct electroweak
symmetry breaking and the observed Higgs mass.

Plasmonic and silicon spherical nanoparticle anti-reflective coatings,"  Over the last decade, plasmonic antireflecting nanostructures have been
extensively studied to be utilized in various optical and optoelectronic
systems such as lenses, solar cells, photodetectors, and others. The growing
interest to all-dielectric photonics as an alternative optical technology along
with plasmonics motivates us to compare antireflection properties of
all-dielectric and plasmonic nanoparticle coatings based on silver and
crystalline silicon. Our results of numerical simulations for periodic arrays
of spherical nanoparticles on top of amorphous silicon show that both silicon
and silver nanoparticle coatings demonstrate strong anti-reflective properties
in the visible spectral range. In this work, we show for the first time that
blooming effect, that is zero reflection from the structure, with silicon
coatings originates from the interference of electric- and magnetic-dipole
responses of nanoparticles with the wave reflected from the substrate, and we
refer to it as substrate-mediated Kerker effect. For the silver coating, our
results agree with previously observed substrate-induced bi-anisotropy and
blooming, caused by substrate-induced magnetic response. Finally, we
numerically show high effectiveness of silicon and silver coatings for the
application in thin-film photovoltaic elements, which is related to the
suppression of reflection from the high-index substrate and increased light
absorbance in the active layer with coating. Depending on the nanoparticle
size, either silicon or silver coating is more efficient, and overall increase
of absorption up to 30% can be achieved.

equations. These equations, sometimes called reduced Navier-Stokes/Prandtl,
appear as a formal limit of the Navier-Stokes system in thin domains, under
certain constraints on the aspect ratio and the Reynolds number. It is known
that without any structural assumption on the initial data, real-analyticity is
both necessary and sufficient for the local well-posedness of the system. In
this paper we prove that for convex initial data, local well-posedness holds
under simple Gevrey regularity.

"Thermodynamics of pharmacological action for electron-accepting
  compounds on activated or damaged cell in the context of Ling's model of the
  living cell","  The theory describing action of medicines explored in this paper is based on
assumption that vital activity of the cell may be described in terms of the
model of two states: resting state and excitation. According to available
physiological data excitation state is dangerous for cell and may cause
different pathological changes, including ""conformational"" diseases, due to
protein aggregation. Normally, the excitation is completely reversible and the
key role is played here by ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate) which disaggregates
proteins of cytomatrix. The same effect ATP exerts during cell injury by
eliciting a ""healing"" effect. Damage of cell structures we consider as
""illness"", whereas removal of pathological consequences caused by protein
aggregation of any origin we will call ""a cure"". The latter is considered as
physical process of cell recovering from excitation/injury to resting state,
which is analyzed in terms of our generalized thermodynamics. ""Cure"" results in
reduction of effective temperature of cell proteins due to binding
intracellular water which is present in the cell at concentration of
approximately 44 M. As a result of the sorption processes mobility of both
water and proteins is greatly reduced, and the corresponding reduction of the
effective temperature seen by us as a measure of treatment effect.

"A bracket polynomial for graphs, IV. Undirected Euler circuits,

marked vertices, motivated by the fact that the Kauffman bracket of a link
diagram D is determined by a looped, marked version of the interlacement graph
associated to a directed Euler system of the universe graph of D. Here we
extend the graph bracket to graphs whose vertices may carry different kinds of
marks, and we show how multiply marked graphs encode interlacement with respect
to arbitrary (undirected) Euler systems. The extended machinery brings together
the earlier version and the graph-links of D. P. Ilyutko and V. O. Manturov [J.
Knot Theory Ramifications 18 (2009), 791-823]. The greater flexibility of the
extended bracket also allows for a recursive description much simpler than that
of the earlier version.

"Estimation of temperature-dependent growth profiles for the assessment
  of time of hatching in forensic entomology","  Forensic entomology contributes important information to crime scene
investigations. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the hatching
time of larvae (or maggots) based on their lengths, the temperature profile at
the crime scene and experimental data on larval development. This requires the
estimation of a time-dependent growth curve from experiments where larvae have
been exposed to a relatively small number of constant temperature profiles.
Since the temperature influences the developmental speed, a crucial step is the
time alignment of the curves at different temperatures. We propose a model for
time varying temperature profiles based on the local growth rate estimated from
the experimental data. This allows us to estimate the most likely hatching time
for a sample of larvae from the crime scene. Asymptotic properties are provided
for the estimators of the growth curves and the hatching time. We explore via
simulations the robustness of the method to errors in the estimated temperature
profile. We also apply the methodology to data from two criminal cases from the
United Kingdom.

Generalized Chung-Feller Theorems for Lattice Paths (Thesis),"  In this thesis we develop generalized versions of the Chung-Feller theorem
for lattice paths constrained in the half plane. The beautiful cycle method
which was developed by Devoretzky and Motzkin as a means to prove the ballot
problem is modified and applied to generalize the classical Chung-Feller
theorem. We use Lagrange inversion to derive the generalized formulas. For the
generating function proof we study various ways of decomposing lattice paths.
We also show some results related to equidistribution properties in terms of
Narayana and Catalan generating functions. We then develop generalized
Chung-Feller theorems for Motzkin and Schroeder paths. Finally we study
generalized paths and the analogue of the Chung-Feller theorem for them.

"Rigorous numerics for ill-posed PDEs: periodic orbits in the Boussinesq
  equation","  In this paper, we develop computer-assisted techniques for the analysis of
periodic orbits of ill-posed partial differential equations. As a case study,
our proposed method is applied to the Boussinesq equation, which has been
investigated extensively because of its role in the theory of shallow water
waves. The idea is to use the symmetry of the solutions and a
Newton-Kantorovich type argument (the radii polynomial approach), to obtain
rigorous proofs of existence of the periodic orbits in a weighted $\ell^1$
Banach space of space-time Fourier coefficients with geometric decay. We
present several computer-assisted proofs of existence of periodic orbits at
different parameter values.

"Imaging Multiple Colloidal Particles by Fitting Electromagnetic
  Scattering Solutions to Digital Holograms","  Digital holographic microscopy is a fast three-dimensional (3D) imaging tool
with many applications in soft matter physics. Recent studies have shown that
electromagnetic scattering solutions can be fit to digital holograms to obtain
the 3D positions of isolated colloidal spheres with nanometer precision and
millisecond temporal resolution. Here we describe the results of new techniques
that extend the range of systems that can be studied with fitting. We show that
an exact multisphere superposition scattering solution can be used to fit
holograms of colloidal clusters containing up to six spheres. We also introduce
an approximate and computationally simpler solution, Mie superposition, that is
valid for multiple spheres spaced several wavelengths or more from one another.
We show that this method can be used to fit holograms of several spheres on an
emulsion droplet, and we give a quantitative criterion for assessing its
validity.

Software Distribution Transparency and Auditability,"  A large user base relies on software updates provided through package
managers. This provides a unique lever for improving the security of the
software update process. We propose a transparency system for software updates
and implement it for a widely deployed Linux package manager, namely APT. Our
system is capable of detecting targeted backdoors without producing overhead
for maintainers. In addition, in our system, the availability of source code is
ensured, the binding between source and binary code is verified using
reproducible builds, and the maintainer responsible for distributing a specific
package can be identified. We describe a novel ""hidden version"" attack against
current software transparency systems and propose as well as integrate a
suitable defense. To address equivocation attacks by the transparency log
server, we introduce tree root cross logging, where the log's Merkle tree root
is submitted into a separately operated log server. This significantly relaxes
the inter-operator cooperation requirements compared to other systems. Our
implementation is evaluated by replaying over 3000 updates of the Debian
operating system over the course of two years, demonstrating its viability and
identifying numerous irregularities.

On transverse stability of discrete line solitons,"  We obtain sharp criteria for transverse stability and instability of line
solitons in the discrete nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations on one- and
two-dimensional lattices near the anti-continuum limit. On a two-dimensional
lattice, the fundamental line soliton is proved to be transversely stable
(unstable) when it bifurcates from the $X$ ($\Gamma$) point of the dispersion
surface. On a one-dimensional (stripe) lattice, the fundamental line soliton is
proved to be transversely unstable for both signs of transverse dispersion. If
this transverse dispersion has the opposite sign to the discrete dispersion,
the instability is caused by a resonance between isolated eigenvalues of
negative energy and the continuous spectrum of positive energy. These results
hold for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities via a staggering
transformation. When the line soliton is transversely unstable, asymptotic
expressions for unstable eigenvalues are also derived. These analytical results
are compared with numerical results, and perfect agreement is obtained.

Approximate joint measurements of qubit observables,"  Joint measurements of qubit observables have recently been studied in
conjunction with quantum information processing tasks such as cloning.
Considerations of such joint measurements have until now been restricted to a
certain class of observables that can be characterized by a form of covariance.
Here we investigate conditions for the joint measurability of arbitrary pairs
of qubit observables. For pairs of noncommuting sharp qubit observables, a
notion of approximate joint measurement is introduced. Optimal approximate
joint measurements are shown to lie in the class of covariant joint
measurements. The marginal observables found to be optimal approximators are
generally not among the coarse-grainings of the observables to be approximated.
This yields scope for the improvement of existing joint measurement schemes.
Both the quality of the approximations and the intrinsic unsharpness of the
approximators are shown to be subject to Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations.

Real-time Progressive 3D Semantic Segmentation for Indoor Scene,"  The widespread adoption of autonomous systems such as drones and assistant
robots has created a need for real-time high-quality semantic scene
segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet robust technique for
on-the-fly dense reconstruction and semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes.
To guarantee (near) real-time performance, our method is built atop an
efficient super-voxel clustering method and a conditional random field with
higher-order constraints from structural and object cues, enabling progressive
dense semantic segmentation without any precomputation. We extensively evaluate
our method on different indoor scenes including kitchens, offices, and bedrooms
in the SceneNN and ScanNet datasets and show that our technique consistently
produces state-of-the-art segmentation results in both qualitative and
quantitative experiments.

"Theory of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of
  strong-field-generated ions","  Strong-field ionization generally produces ions in a superposition of ionic
eigenstates. This superposition is generally not fully coherent und must be
described in terms of a density matrix. A recent experiment [E. Goulielmakis et
al., Nature 466, 739 (2010)] employed attosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy to determine the density matrix of strong-field-generated Kr+
ions. The experimentally observed degree of coherence of the
strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is well reproduced by a recently developed
multichannel strong-field-ionization theory. But there is significant
disagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of
alignment of the Kr+ ions. In the present paper, the theory underlying
attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is
developed. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative
nature of the strong-field-ionization process is systematically taken into
account. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the
interpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and
numerically. It is shown that attosecond pulse propagation effects cannot
explain why the experimentally determined degree of alignment of
strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is much smaller than predicted by existing
theory.

"Effective chiral magnetic currents, topological magnetic charges, and
  microwave vortices in a cavity with an enclosed ferrite disk","  In microwaves, a TE-polarized rectangular-waveguide resonator with an
inserted thin ferrite disk gives an example of a nonintegrable system. The
interplay of reflection and transmission at the disk interfaces together with
the material gyrotropy effect gives rise to whirlpool-like electromagnetic
vortices in the proximity of the ferromagnetic resonance. Based on numerical
simulation, we show that a character of microwave vortices in a cavity can be
analyzed by means of consideration of equivalent magnetic currents. Maxwell
equations allows introduction of a magnetic current as a source of the
electromagnetic field. Specifically, we found that in such nonintegrable
structures, magnetic gyrotropy and geometrical factors leads to the effect of
symmetry breaking resulting in effective chiral magnetic currents and
topological magnetic charges. As an intriguing fact, one can observe precessing
behavior of the electric-dipole polarization inside a ferrite disk.

"Sparse Online Low-Rank Projection and Outlier Rejection (SOLO) for 3-D
  Rigid-Body Motion Registration","  Motivated by an emerging theory of robust low-rank matrix representation, in
this paper, we introduce a novel solution for online rigid-body motion
registration. The goal is to develop algorithmic techniques that enable a
robust, real-time motion registration solution suitable for low-cost, portable
3-D camera devices. Assuming 3-D image features are tracked via a standard
tracker, the algorithm first utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape
representation of the rigid body. Robust PCA finds the global optimal solution
of the initialization, while its complexity is comparable to singular value
decomposition. In the online update stage, we propose a more efficient
algorithm for sparse subspace projection to sequentially project new feature
observations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update stage guarantees
the real-time performance of the solution while maintaining good registration
even when the image sequence is contaminated by noise, gross data corruption,
outlying features, and missing data. The state-of-the-art accuracy of the
solution is validated through extensive simulation and a real-world experiment,
while the system enjoys one to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to
well-established RANSAC solutions. The new algorithm will be released online to
aid peer evaluation.

Reinforcement Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations,"  Robust real-world learning should benefit from both demonstrations and
interactions with the environment. Current approaches to learning from
demonstration and reward perform supervised learning on expert demonstration
data and use reinforcement learning to further improve performance based on the
reward received from the environment. These tasks have divergent losses which
are difficult to jointly optimize and such methods can be very sensitive to
noisy demonstrations. We propose a unified reinforcement learning algorithm,
Normalized Actor-Critic (NAC), that effectively normalizes the Q-function,
reducing the Q-values of actions unseen in the demonstration data. NAC learns
an initial policy network from demonstrations and refines the policy in the
environment, surpassing the demonstrator's performance. Crucially, both
learning from demonstration and interactive refinement use the same objective,
unlike prior approaches that combine distinct supervised and reinforcement
losses. This makes NAC robust to suboptimal demonstration data since the method
is not forced to mimic all of the examples in the dataset. We show that our
unified reinforcement learning algorithm can learn robustly and outperform
existing baselines when evaluated on several realistic driving games.

"Spin Susceptibility of the Topological Superconductor UPt3 from
  Polarized Neutron Diffraction","  Experiment and theory indicate that UPt3 is a topological superconductor in
an odd-parity state, based in part from temperature independence of the NMR
Knight shift. However, quasiparticle spin-flip scattering near a surface, where
the Knight shift is measured, might be responsible. We use polarized neutron
scattering to measure the bulk susceptibility with H||c, finding consistency
with the Knight shift but inconsistent with theory for this field orientation.
We infer that neither spin susceptibility nor Knight shift are a reliable
indication of odd-parity.

"Mobile Geometric Graphs: Detection, Coverage and Percolation","  We consider the following dynamic Boolean model introduced by van den Berg,
Meester and White (1997). At time 0, let the nodes of the graph be a Poisson
point process in R^d with constant intensity and let each node move
independently according to Brownian motion. At any time t, we put an edge
between every pair of nodes if their distance is at most r. We study three
features in this model: detection (the time until a target point---fixed or
moving---is within distance r from some node of the graph), coverage (the time
until all points inside a finite box are detected by the graph), and
percolation (the time until a given node belongs to the infinite connected
component of the graph). We obtain precise asymptotics for these features by
combining ideas from stochastic geometry, coupling and multi-scale analysis.

"Muons enhancements at sea level in association with Swift-BAT and
  MILAGRO triggers","  Recently, triggers occurring during high background rate intervals have been
reporter by Swift-BAT Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) detector. Among them, there were
two on January 24, two on January 25, and two on February 13, and 18, all in
2008. These Swift-BAT triggers in most cases are probably noise triggers that
occurred while Swift was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). In fact, we
show that they happen during a plentiful precipitation of high energy particles
in the SAA, producing muons in the atmosphere detected by two directional
telescopes at sea level, inside the SAA region (Tupi experiment). They look
like sharp peaks in the muon counting rate. In the same category are two
triggers from MILAGRO ground based detector, on January 25 and 31, 2008
respectively. In addition, the trigger coordinates are close to (and, in two
cases, inside) the field of view of the telescopes. From an additional analysis
in the behavior of the muon counting rate, it is possible to conclude that the
events are produced by precipitation of high energy charged particles in the
SAA region. Thus, due to its localization, the Tupi experiment constitutes a
new sensor of high energy particle precipitation in the SAA, and it can be
useful in the identification of some triggers of Gamma Ray Burst detectors.

"Thermal effects on the resonance fluorescence of doubly dressed
  artificial atoms","  In this work, robustness of controlled density of optical states in doubly
driven artificial atoms is studied under phonon dissipation. By using both
perturbative and polaron approaches, we investigate the influence of
carrier-phonon interactions on the emission properties of a two-level
solid-state emitter, simultaneously coupled to two intense distinguishable
lasers. Phonon decoherence effects on the emission spectra are found modest up
to neon boiling temperatures ($\sim 30$ K), as compared with photon generation
at the Fourier transform limit obtained in absence of lattice vibrations (zero
temperature). These results show that optical switching and photonic modulation
by means of double dressing, do not require ultra low temperatures for
implementation, thus boosting its potential technological applications.

"Fisher information analysis of list-mode SPECT emission data for joint
  estimation of activity and attenuation distribution","  The potential to perform attenuation and scatter compensation (ASC) in
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using only the SPECT
emission data is highly significant. In this context, attenuation in SPECT is
primarily due to Compton scattering, where the probability of Compton scatter
is proportional to the attenuation coefficient of the tissue and the energy of
the scattered photon and the scattering angle are related. Given this premise,
we investigate whether the SPECT scattered-photon data acquired in list-mode
(LM) format and including the energy information can be used to estimate the
attenuation map. For this purpose, we propose a Fisher-information-based method
that yields the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the task of jointly estimating the
activity/attenuation distribution using only the SPECT emission data. The
proposed method is applied to analyze the information content of SPECT LM
emission data in a 2D SPECT system using computational studies with digital
phantoms for different photon-count levels. The results show that scattered
photons contain information to estimate the attenuation coefficients. An
increase in the number of detected photons leads to lower CRB for both the
attenuation and activity coefficients. Also, the CRB obtained for the
attenuation and activity coefficients is typically much lower than the true
value of these coefficients. Further, processing the emission data in LM format
yields a lower CRB in comparison to binning data. Finally, we observe that
systems with better energy resolution yield a lower CRB for the attenuation
coefficient. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that LM SPECT
emission data, including the scattered photons, contains information to jointly
estimate the activity and attenuation coefficients.

Bounding milli-magnetically charged particles with magnetars,"  Milli-magnetically charged particles generically appear in scenarios with
kinetic mixing. We present model independent bounds on these particles coming
from magnetars. Schwinger pair production discharges the magnetic field of the
magnetar. Thus the existence of large magnetic fields at magnetars place strong
bounds on the milli-magnetic charge to be smaller than $10^{-18}$ over a large

Fixed Functionals in Asymptotically Safe Gravity,"  We summarize the status of constructing fixed functionals within the

Focusing on curvatures much larger than the IR-cutoff scale, it is shown that
the fixed point equation admits three different scaling regimes: for classical
and quantum dominance the equation becomes linear and has power-law solutions,
while the balanced case gives rise to a generalized homogeneous equation whose
order is reduced by one and whose solutions are non-analytical.

"A Critical Centre-Stable Manifold for the Cubic Focusing Schroedinger
  Equation in Three Dimensions","  Consider the H^{1/2}-critical Schroedinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity
in R^3, i \partial_t \psi + \Delta \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi = 0. It admits an
eight-dimensional manifold of periodic solutions called solitons e^{i(\Gamma +
vx - t|v|^2 + \alpha^2 t)} \phi(x-2tv-D, \alpha), where \phi(x, \alpha) is a
positive ground state solution of the semilinear elliptic equation -\Delta \phi
+ \alpha^2\phi = \phi^3. We prove that in the neighborhood of the soliton
manifold there exists a H^{1/2} real analytic manifold N of asymptotically
stable solutions of the Schroedinger equation, meaning they are the sum of a
moving soliton and a dispersive term. Furthermore, a solution starting on N
remains on N for all positive time and for some finite negative time and N can
be identified as the centre-stable manifold for this equation. The proof is
based on the method of modulation, introduced by Soffer and Weinstein and
adapted by Schlag to the L^2-supercritical case. Novel elements include a
different linearization and new Strichartz-type estimates for the linear
Schroedinger equation. The main result depends on a spectral assumption
concerning the absence of embedded eigenvalues. We also establish several new
estimates for solutions of the time-dependent and time-independent linear
Schroedinger equation, which hold under sharper or more general conditions than
previously known. Several of these estimates are based on a new approach that
makes use of Wiener's Theorem in the context of function spaces.

Information storage capacity of discrete spin systems,"  Understanding the limits imposed on information storage capacity of physical
systems is a problem of fundamental and practical importance which bridges
physics and information science. There is a well-known upper bound on the
amount of information that can be stored reliably in a given volume of discrete
spin systems which are supported by gapped local Hamiltonians. However, all the
previously known systems were far below this theoretical bound, and it remained
open whether there exists a gapped spin system that saturates this bound. Here,
we present a construction of spin systems which saturate this theoretical limit
asymptotically by borrowing an idea from fractal properties arising in the
Sierpinski triangle. Our construction provides not only the best classical
error-correcting code which is physically realizable as the energy ground space
of gapped frustration-free Hamiltonians, but also a new research avenue for
correlated spin phases with fractal spin configurations.

"On the age and formation mechanism of the core of the Quadrantid
  meteoroid stream","  The Quadrantid meteor shower is among the strongest annual meteor showers,
and has drawn the attention of scientists for several decades. The stream is
unusual, among others, for several reasons: its very short duration around
maximum activity (~12 - 14 hours) as detected by visual, photographic and radar
observations, its recent onset (around 1835 AD) and because it had been the
only major stream without an obvious parent body until 2003. Ever since, there
have been debates as to the age of the stream and the nature of its proposed
parent body, asteroid 2003 EH1.
  In this work, we present results on the most probable age and formation
mechanism of the narrow portion of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream. For the
first time we use data on eight high precision photographic Quadrantids,
equivalent to gram - kilogram size, to constrain the most likely age of the
core of the stream. Out of eight high-precision photographic Quadrantids, five
pertain directly to the narrow portion of the stream. In addition, we also use
data on five high-precision radar Quadrantids, observed within the peak of the
shower.
  We performed backwards numerical integrations of the equations of motion of a
large number of 'clones' of both, the eight high-precision photographic and
five radar Quadrantid meteors, along with the proposed parent body, 2003 EH1.
According to our results, from the backward integrations, the most likely age
of the narrow structure of the Quadrantids is between 200 - 300 years. These
presumed ejection epochs, corresponding to 1700 - 1800 AD, are then used for
forward integrations of large numbers of hypothetical meteoroids, ejected from
the parent 2003 EH$_1$, until the present epoch. The aim is to constrain
whether the core of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream is consistent with a
previously proposed relatively young age (~ 200 years).}

Robust Stackelberg game in communication systems,"  This paper studies multi-user communication systems with two groups of users:
leaders which possess system information, and followers which have no system
information using the formulation of Stackelberg games. In such games, the
leaders play and choose their actions based on their information about the
system and the followers choose their actions myopically according to their
observations of the aggregate impact of other users. However, obtaining the
exact value of these parameters is not practical in communication systems. To
study the effect of uncertainty and preserve the players' utilities in these
conditions, we introduce a robust equilibrium for Stackelberg games. In this
framework, the leaders' information and the followers' observations are
uncertain parameters, and the leaders and the followers choose their actions by
solving the worst-case robust optimizations. We show that the followers'
uncertain parameters always increase the leaders' utilities and decrease the
followers' utilities. Conversely, the leaders' uncertain information reduces
the leaders' utilities and increases the followers' utilities. We illustrate
our theoretical results with the numerical results obtained based on the power
control games in the interference channels.

"Alternative explanations for extreme supersolar iron abundances inferred
  from the energy spectrum of Cygnus X-1","  Here we study a 1-200 keV energy spectrum of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1
taken with NuSTAR and Suzaku. This is the first report of a NuSTAR observation
of Cyg X-1 in the intermediate state, and the observation was taken during the
part of the binary orbit where absorption due to the companion's stellar wind
is minimal. The spectrum includes a multi-temperature thermal disk component, a
cutoff power-law component, and relativistic and non-relativistic reflection
components. Our initial fits with publicly available constant density
reflection models (relxill and reflionx) lead to extremely high iron abundances
(>9.96 and 10.6(+1.6)(-0.9) times solar, respectively). Although supersolar
iron abundances have been reported previously for Cyg X-1, our measurements are
much higher and such variability is almost certainly unphysical. Using a new
version of reflionx that we modified to make the electron density a free
parameter, we obtain better fits to the spectrum even with solar iron
abundances. We report on how the higher density (n_e = (3.98(+0.12)(-0.25))E20
cm-3) impacts other parameters such as the inner radius and inclination of the
disk.

"Arbitrary control of the polarization and intensity profiles of
  diffraction-attenuation-resistant beams along their propagation direction","  We report on the theory and experimental generation of a class of
diffraction-attenuation-resistant beams with state of polarization (SoP) and
intensity that can be controlled on demand along the propagation direction.
This is achieved by a suitable superposition of Bessel beams, whose parameters
are systematically chosen based on closed-form analytic expressions provided by
the Frozen Waves (FWs) method. Using an amplitude-only spatial light modulator,
we experimentally demonstrate three scenarios. In the first, the SoP of a
horizontally polarized beam evolves to radial polarization and is then changed
to vertical polarization, with the beam intensity held constant. In the second,
we simultaneously control the SoP and the longitudinal intensity profile, which
was chosen such that the beam's central ring can be switched-off over
predefined space regions, thus generating multiple foci with different SoP and
at different intensity levels along the propagation. Finally, the ability to
control the SoP while overcoming attenuation inside lossy fluids is shown
experimentally for the first time in the literature (to the best of our
knowledge). Therefore, we envision our proposed method to be of great interest
for many applications, such as optical tweezers, atom guiding, material
processing, microscopy, and optical communications.

"Discriminative variable selection for clustering with the sparse
  Fisher-EM algorithm","  The interest in variable selection for clustering has increased recently due
to the growing need in clustering high-dimensional data. Variable selection
allows in particular to ease both the clustering and the interpretation of the
results. Existing approaches have demonstrated the efficiency of variable
selection for clustering but turn out to be either very time consuming or not
sparse enough in high-dimensional spaces. This work proposes to perform a
selection of the discriminative variables by introducing sparsity in the
loading matrix of the Fisher-EM algorithm. This clustering method has been
recently proposed for the simultaneous visualization and clustering of
high-dimensional data. It is based on a latent mixture model which fits the
data into a low-dimensional discriminative subspace. Three different approaches
are proposed in this work to introduce sparsity in the orientation matrix of
the discriminative subspace through $\ell_{1}$-type penalizations. Experimental
comparisons with existing approaches on simulated and real-world data sets
demonstrate the interest of the proposed methodology. An application to the
segmentation of hyperspectral images of the planet Mars is also presented.

Blocked-braid Groups,"  We introduce and study a family of groups $\mathbf{BB}_n$, called the
blocked-braid groups, which are quotients of Artin's braid groups
$\mathbf{B}_n$, and have the corresponding symmetric groups $\Sigma_n$ as
quotients. They are defined by adding a certain class of geometrical
modifications to braids. They arise in the study of commutative Frobenius
algebras and tangle algebras in braided strict monoidal categories. A
fundamental equation true in $\mathbf{BB}_n$ is Dirac's Belt Trick; that
torsion through $4\pi$ is equal to the identity. We show that $\mathbf{BB}_n$
is finite for $n=1,2$ and 3 but infinite for $n>3$.

A Novel Spectrally-Efficient Scheme for Physical Layer Network Coding,"  In this paper, we propose a novel three-time-slot transmission scheme
combined with an efficient embedded linear channel equalization (ELCE)
technique for the Physical layer Network Coding (PNC). Our transmission scheme,
we achieve about 33% increase in the spectral efficiency over the conventional

derive an exact expression for the endto- end BER of the proposed
three-time-slot transmission scheme combined with the proposed ELCE technique
for BPSK transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that the exact expression
for the end-to-end BER is consistent with the BER simulation results.

Some effectivity questions for plane Cremona transformations,"  We give a way of estimating quickly the length of the hyperbolic isometry
associated to a plane Cremona transformation that is presented as the product
of two involutions. We also show, using the ideas of Cantat and Lamy, that,
provided that the ground field is either algebraic of characteristic not 2 or
of characteristic zero, the normal closure of a high power of such a
transformation is a proper subgroup of the Cremona group; this gives an
effective instantiation of some of their results. Moreover, we show that any
hyperbolic Cremona transformation is rigid and give a simple criterion for it
to be tight.
  This version is thoroughly revised from the previous version. In particular,
it corrects an error in an earlier version that was pointed out by Lonjou.

"A propeller model for the sub-luminous disk state of the transitional
  millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038","  The discovery of millisecond pulsars switching between states powered either
by the rotation of their magnetic field or by the accretion of matter, has
recently proved the tight link shared by millisecond radio pulsars and neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Transitional millisecond pulsars also show an
enigmatic intermediate state in which the neutron star is surrounded by an
accretion disk, it emits coherent X-ray pulsations, but is sub-luminous in
X-rays with respect to accreting neutron stars, and is brighter in gamma-rays
than millisecond pulsars in the rotation-powered state. Here, we model the
X-ray and gamma-ray emission observed from PSR J1023+0038 in such a state based
on the assumption that most of the disk in-flow is propelled away by the
rapidly rotating neutron star magnetosphere, and that electrons can be
accelerated to energies of a few GeV at the turbulent disk-magnetosphere
boundary. We show that the synchrotron and self-synchrotron Compton emission
coming from such a region, together with the hard disk emission typical of low
states of accreting compact objects, is able to explain the radiation observed
in the X-ray and gamma-ray band. The average emission observed from PSR
J1023+0038 is modelled by a disk in-flow with a rate of $(1-3)\times10^{-11}
M_{\odot}/yr$, truncated at a radius ranging between 30 and 45 km, compatible
with the hypothesis of a propelling magnetosphere. We compare the results we
obtained with models that rather assume that a rotation-powered pulsar is
turned on, showing how the spin down power released in similar scenarios is
hardly able to account for the magnitude of the observed emission.

"Strong electroweak symmetry breaking (or, if no SM Higgs, then what?)","  While the LHC takes on the challenge of experimentally exploring the
electroweak symmetry breaking sector, it is not only interesting but also
crucial to explore alternatives to the Standard Model scenario with an
elementary scalar Higgs boson. The idea of electroweak symmetry breaking by
some new strong dynamics is discussed. A simple, general and self-consistent
low energy effective description of Higgsless models is introduced. This
effective theory is studied from the point of view of prolonging perturbative
unitarity of WW scattering by spin-1 resonances originating from the strongly
interacting sector. The LHC phenomenology and the discovery potential for these
spin-1 resonances is also discussed. The role of spin-1 resonances is then
considered on the grounds of composite Higgs models. A general prescription for
the explicit inclusion of such resonances in the effective Lagrangian
description of these models is presented.

"A compact, metal-rich, kpc-scale outflow in FBQS J0209-0438: Detailed
  diagnostics from HST/COS extreme UV observations","  We present HST/COS observations of highly ionized absorption lines associated
with a radio-loud QSO at $z=1.1319$. The absorption system has multiple
velocity components, tracing gas that is largely outflowing from the QSO at
velocities of a few 100 km s$^{-1}$. There is an unprecedented range in
ionization, with detections of HI, NIII, NIV, NV, OIV, OIV*, OV, OVI, NeVIII,
MgX, SV and ArVIII. We estimate the total hydrogen number density from the
column density ratio N(OIV*)/N(OIV) to be
$\log(n_{\textrm{H}}/\textrm{cm}^3)\sim 3$. Assuming photoionization
equilibrium, we derive a distance to the absorbing complex of $2.3<R<6.0$ kpc
from the centre of the QSO. A range in ionization parameter, covering $\sim 2$
orders of magnitude, suggest absorption path lengths in the range
$10^{-4.5}<l_{\textrm{abs}}<1$ pc. In addition, the absorbing gas only
partially covers the background emission from the QSO continuum, which suggests
clouds with transverse sizes $l_{\textrm{trans}}<10^{-2.5}$ pc. Widely
differing absorption path lengths, combined with covering fractions less than
unity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloud
geometries. These issues may be mitigated by the presence of non-equilibrium
effects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures. The
dynamics and expected lifetimes of the gas clouds suggest that they do not
originate from close to the AGN, but are instead formed close to their observed
location. Their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities are
broadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations in
winds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretion
disc. In the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not trace
the bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as an
accompanying warm absorber, detectable in X-rays.

New Ambitwistor String Theories,"  We describe new ambitwistor string theories that give rise to the recent
amplitude formulae for Einstein-Yang-Mills, (Dirac)-Born-Infeld, Galileons and
others introduced by Cachazo, He and Yuan. In the case of the
Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes, an important role is played by a novel
worldsheet conformal field theory that provides the appropriate colour factors
precisely without the spurious multitrace terms of earlier models that had to
be ignored by hand. This is needed to obtain the correct multitrace terms that
arise when Yang-Mills is coupled to gravity.

"Formation, Habitability, and Detection of Extrasolar Moons","  The diversity and quantity of moons in the Solar System suggest a manifold
population of natural satellites exist around extrasolar planets. Of peculiar
interest from an astrobiological perspective, the number of sizable moons in
the stellar habitable zones may outnumber planets in these circumstellar
regions. With technological and theoretical methods now allowing for the
detection of sub-Earth-sized extrasolar planets, the first detection of an
extrasolar moon appears feasible. In this review, we summarize formation
channels of massive exomoons that are potentially detectable with current or
near-future instruments. We discuss the orbital effects that govern exomoon
evolution, we present a framework to characterize an exomoon's stellar plus
planetary illumination as well as its tidal heating, and we address the
techniques that have been proposed to search for exomoons. Most notably, we
show that natural satellites in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 Earth mass (i) are
potentially habitable, (ii) can form within the circumplanetary debris and gas
disk or via capture from a binary, and (iii) are detectable with current
technology.

"Polylogarithmic equilibrium treatment of molecular aggregation and
  critical concentrations","  A full equilibrium treatment of molecular aggregation is presented for
prototypes of 1D and 3D aggregates, with and without nucleation. By skipping
complex kinetic parameters like aggregate size-dependent diffusion, the
equilibrium treatment allows to predict directly time-independent quantities
such as critical concentrations. The relationships between the macroscopic
equilibrium constants for the different paths are first established by
statistical corrections and so as to comply with the detailed balance
constraints imposed by nucleation, and the composition of the mixture resulting
from homogeneous aggregation is then analyzed using the polylogarithm function.
Several critical concentrations are distinguished: the residual monomer
concentation in equilibrium (RMC) and the critical nucleation concentration
(CNC), that is the threshold concentration of total subunits necessary for
initiating aggregation. When increasing the concentration of total subunits,
the RMC converges more strongly to its asymptotic value, the equilibrium
constant of depolymerization, for 3D aggregates and in case of nucleation. The
CNC moderately depends on the number of subunits in the nucleus, but sharply
increases with the difference between the equilibrium constants of
polymerization and nucleation. As the RMC and CNC can be numerically but not
analytically determined, ansatz equations connecting them to thermodynamic
parameters are proposed.

"Freezing and extreme value statistics in a Random Energy Model with
  logarithmically correlated potential","  We investigate some implications of the freezing scenario proposed by
Carpentier and Le Doussal (CLD) for a random energy model (REM) with
logarithmically correlated random potential. We introduce a particular
(circular) variant of the model, and show that the integer moments of the
partition function in the high-temperature phase are given by the well-known
Dyson Coulomb gas integrals. The CLD freezing scenario allows one to use those
moments for extracting the distribution of the free energy in both high- and
low-temperature phases. In particular, it yields the full distribution of the
minimal value in the potential sequence. This provides an explicit new class of
extreme-value statistics for strongly correlated variables, manifestly
different from the standard Gumbel class.

Formation of helical ion chains,"  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the linear to zigzag structural phase
transition exhibited by an ion chain confined in a trap with periodic boundary
conditions. The transition is driven by reducing the transverse confinement at
a finite quench rate, which can be accurately controlled. This results in the
formation of zigzag domains oriented along different transverse planes. The
twists between different domains can be stabilized by the topology of the trap
and under laser cooling the system has a chance to relax to a helical chain
with nonzero winding number. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to obtain
a large sample of possible trajectories for different quench rates. The scaling
of the average winding number with different quench rates is compared to the
prediction of the Kibble-Zurek theory, and a good quantitative agreement is
found.

Beyond Node Degree: Evaluating AS Topology Models,"  Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System (AS)
topologies, most of which make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In
this paper we compare AS topology generation models with several observed AS
topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid making assumptions
about which topological properties are important to characterize the AS
topology. Our analysis shows that, although matching degree-based properties,
the existing AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity of
the local interconnection structure between ASs. Furthermore, we use BGP data
from multiple vantage points to show that additional measurement locations
significantly affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node
centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by
additional measurements locations. These observations are particularly valid in
the core. The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an
underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the core caused by
inappropriate use of BGP data.

"Interface induced Zeeman-protected superconductivity in ultrathin
  crystalline lead films","  Two dimensional (2D) superconducting systems are of great importance to
exploring exotic quantum physics. Recent development of fabrication techniques
stimulates the studies of high quality single crystalline 2D superconductors,
where intrinsic properties give rise to unprecedented physical phenomena. Here
we report the observation of Zeeman-type spin-orbit interaction protected
superconductivity (Zeeman-protected superconductivity) in 4 monolayer (ML) to 6
ML crystalline Pb films grown on striped incommensurate (SIC) Pb layers on
Si(111) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Anomalous large in-plane
critical field far beyond the Pauli limit is detected, which can be attributed
to the Zeeman-protected superconductivity due to the in-plane inversion
symmetry breaking at the interface. Our work demonstrates that in
superconducting heterostructures the interface can induce Zeeman-type
spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and modulate the superconductivity.

"Electronic, magnetic and transport properties of Fe intercalated
  2H-TaS$_2$ studied by means of the KKR-CPA method","  The electronic, magnetic and transport properties of Fe intercalated
2H-TaS$_2$ have been investigated by means of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR)
method. The non-stoichiometry and disorder in the system has been accounted for
using the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) alloy theory. A pronounced
influence of disorder on the spin magnetic moment has been found for the
ferro-magnetically ordered material. The same applies for the spin-orbit
induced orbital magnetic moment and magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy. The
temperature-dependence of the resistivity of disordered 2H-Fe$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$
investigated on the basis of the Kubo-St\v{r}eda formalism in combination with
the alloy analogy model has been found in very satisfying agreement with
experimental data. This also holds for the temperature dependent anomalous Hall
resistivity $ \rho_{\rm xy}(T) $. The role of thermally induced lattice
vibrations and spin fluctuations for the transport properties is discussed in
detail.

look in laboratory experiment identical to single active states, the CP phase
factors associated with active-sterile mixing might cause cancellations in the
effective electron neutrino mass $m_{ee}$ measured in the neutrinoless double
beta decay experiments thereby revealing the split nature of states.

"Stationary states and quantum quench dynamics of Bose-Einstein
  condensates in a double-well potential","  We consider the properties of stationary states and the dynamics of
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double-well (DW) potential with pair
tunneling by using a full quantum-mechanical treatment. Furthermore, we study
the quantum quench dynamics of the DW system subjected to a sudden change of
the Peierls phase. It is shown that strong pair tunneling evidently influences
the energy spectrum structure of the stationary states. For relatively weak
repulsive interatomic interactions, the dynamics of the DW system with a
maximal initial population difference evolves from Josephson oscillations to
quantum self-trapping as one increases the pair tunneling strength, while for
large repulsion the strong pair tunneling inhibits the quantum self-trapping.
In the case of attractive interatomic interactions, strong pair tunneling tends
to destroy the Josephson oscillations and quantum self-trapping, and the system
eventually enters a symmetric regime of zero population difference. Finally,
the effect of the Peierls phase on the quantum quench dynamics of the system is
analyzed and discussed. These new features are remarkably different from the
usual dynamical behaviors of a BEC in a DW potential.

Information Security Management of Web Portals Based on Joomla CMS,"  Information is the key asset of all organizations and can exist in many
forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by mail or by electronic means, shown in films, or spoken in
conversation. In today's competitive business environment, such information is
constantly under threat from many sources, which can be internal, external,
accidental, or malicious. Joomla is a very popular Content Management System
(CMS) used for web page maintenance. This highly versatile software has found
itself in both large corporate web portals, and simple web pages such as blogs.
Such popularity increases its vulnerability to potential attacks and therefore
needs an appropriate security management. ISO (the International Organization
for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission)
created the series of standards aimed at providing a model for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an
Information Security Management System (ISMS). This paper shows how principles
set in ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards can be used to improve security of
Joomla based web portals.

"On the numerical treatment of dissipative particle dynamics and related
  systems","  We review and compare numerical methods that simultaneously control
temperature while preserving the momentum, a family of particle simulation
methods commonly used for the modelling of complex fluids and polymers. The
class of methods considered includes dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as
well as extended stochastic-dynamics models incorporating a generalized
pairwise thermostat scheme in which stochastic forces are eliminated and the
coefficient of dissipation is treated as an additional auxiliary variable
subject to a feedback (kinetic energy) control mechanism. In the latter case,
we consider the addition of a coupling of the auxiliary variable, as in the
Nos\'{e}-Hoover-Langevin (NHL) method, with stochastic dynamics to ensure
ergodicity, and find that the convergence of ensemble averages is substantially
improved. To this end, splitting methods are developed and studied in terms of
their thermodynamic accuracy, two-point correlation functions, and convergence.
In terms of computational efficiency as measured by the ratio of thermodynamic
accuracy to CPU time, we report significant advantages in simulation for the
pairwise NHL method compared to popular alternative schemes (up to an 80\%
improvement), without degradation of convergence rate. The momentum-conserving
thermostat technique described here provides a consistent hydrodynamic model in
the low-friction regime, but it will also be of use in both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium molecular simulation applications owing to its efficiency and
simple numerical implementation.

"Ambient Backscatter Networking: A Novel Paradigm to Assist Wireless
  Powered Communications","  Ambient backscatter communication technology has been introduced recently,
and is then quickly becoming a promising choice for self-sustainable
communication systems as an external power supply or a dedicated carrier
emitter is not required. By leveraging existing RF signal resources, ambient
backscatter technology can support sustainable and independent communications
and consequently open up a whole new set of applications that facilitate
Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this article, we study an integration of ambient
backscatter with wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). We first
present an overview of backscatter communication systems with an emphasis on
the emerging ambient backscatter technology. Then we propose a novel hybrid
transmitter design by combining the advantages of both ambient backscatter and
wireless powered communications. Furthermore, in the cognitive radio
environment, we introduce a multiple access scheme to coordinate the hybrid
data transmissions. The performance evaluation shows that the hybrid
transmitter outperforms traditional designs. In addition, we discuss some open
issues related to the ambient backscatter networking.

tension for a periodic perimeter homogenization problem (in a regular and

irrational directions, while in other directions, it is differentiable if and

A large deviations principle for the Maki-Thompson rumour model,"  We consider the stochastic model for the propagation of a rumour within a

never hearing the rumour converges in probability to $0.2032$. Watson later
derived the asymptotic normality of a suitably scaled version of this
proportion. We prove a corresponding large deviations principle, with an
explicit formula for the rate function.

"On Maximizing Energy and Data Delivery in Dense Wireless Local Area
  Networks","  Devices can now be powered wirelessly by Access Points (APs). However, an AP
cannot transmit frequently to charge devices as it may starve other nearby APs
operating on the same channel. Consequently, there is a need to schedule the
transmissions of APs to ensure their data queues remain short whilst charging
energy-harvesting devices. We present a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process
(MDP) to capture the queue states at APs and also channel conditions to nodes.
We then use the MDP to investigate the following transmission policies: max
weight, max queue, best channel state and random. Our results show that the max
weight policy has the best performance in terms of queue length and delivered
energy.

"High-loop perturbative renormalization constants for Lattice QCD (II):
  three-loop quark currents for tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action and
  n_f=2 Wilson fermions","  Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory was able to get three- (and even
four-) loop results for finite Lattice QCD renormalization constants. More
recently, a conceptual and technical framework has been devised to tame finite
size effects, which had been reported to be significant for (logarithmically)
divergent renormalization constants. In this work we present three-loop results
for fermion bilinears in the Lattice QCD regularization defined by tree-level
Symanzik improved gauge action and n_f=2 Wilson fermions. We discuss both
finite and divergent renormalization constants in the RI'-MOM scheme. Since
renormalization conditions are defined in the chiral limit, our results also
apply to Twisted Mass QCD, for which non-perturbative computations of the same
quantities are available. We emphasize the importance of carefully accounting
for both finite lattice space and finite volume effects. In our opinion the
latter have in general not attracted the attention they would deserve.

derived, and they are going to be compared with those attained through the
displacement operator method. The corresponding wave function will be found,
and a general procedure for obtaining several expected values involving the
canonical operators in these states will be described. The results will be

"Analysis of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Beam Profile Sensitivity for
  Neuromodulation of the Human Brain","  Objective. While ultrasound is largely established for use in diagnostic
imaging and heating therapies, its application for neuromodulation is
relatively new and not well understood. The objective of the present study was
to investigate issues related to interactions between focused acoustic beams
and brain tissues to better understand possible limitations of transcranial
ultrasound for neuromodulation. Approach. A computational model of transcranial
focused ultrasound was constructed and validated against bench top experimental
data. The models were then incrementally extended to address and investigate a
number of issues related to the use of ultrasound for neuromodulation. These
included the effect of variations in skull geometry and gyral anatomy, as well
as the effect of transmission across multiple tissue and media layers, such as
scalp, skull, CSF, and gray/white matter on ultrasound insertion behavior. In
addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to characterize the influence of
acoustic properties of intracranial tissues. Finally, the heating associated
with ultrasonic stimulation waveforms designed for neuromodulation was modeled.
Main results. Depending on factors such as acoustic frequency, the insertion
behavior of a transcranial focused ultrasound beam is only subtly influenced by
the geometry and acoustic properties of the underlying tissues. Significance.
These issues are critical for the refinement of device design and the overall
advancement of ultrasound methods for noninvasive neuromodulation.

Hyperbolic Graph Generator,"  Networks representing many complex systems in nature and society share some
common structural properties like heterogeneous degree distributions and strong
clustering. Recent research on network geometry has shown that those real
networks can be adequately modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic
spaces. In this paper, we present a computer program to generate such graphs.
Besides real-world-like networks, the program can generate random graphs from
other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model, random
geometric graphs on a circle, or Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. The
simulations show a good match between the expected values of different network
structural properties and the corresponding empirical values measured in
generated graphs, confirming the accurate behavior of the program.

A Concurrent Global-local Numerical Method for Multiscale PDEs,"  We present a new hybrid numerical method for multiscale partial differential
equations, which simultaneously captures the global macroscopic information and
resolves the local microscopic events over regions of relatively small size.
The method couples concurrently the microscopic coefficients in the region of
interest with the homogenized coefficients elsewhere. The cost of the method is
comparable to the heterogeneous multiscale method, while being able to recover
microscopic information of the solution. The convergence of the method is
proved for problems with bounded and measurable coefficients, while the rate of
convergence is established for problems with rapidly oscillating periodic or
almost-periodic coefficients. Numerical results are reported to show the
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

"s-wave Superconductivity Phase Diagram in the Inhomogeneous
  Two-Dimensional Attractive Hubbard Model","  We study s-wave superconductivity in the two-dimensional square lattice
attractive Hubbard Hamiltonian for various inhomogeneous patterns of
interacting sites. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean field
approximation, we obtain the phase diagram for inhomogeneous patterns in which
the on-site attractive interaction U_i between the electrons takes on two
values, U_i=0 and -U/(1-f) (with f the concentration of non-interacting sites)
as a function of average electron occupation per site n, and study the
evolution of the phase diagram as f varies. In certain regions of the phase
diagram, inhomogeneity results in a larger zero temperature average pairing
amplitude (order parameter) and also a higher superconducting (SC) critical
temperature T_c, relative to a uniform system with the same mean interaction
strength (U_i=-U on all sites). These effects are observed for stripes,
checkerboard, and even random patterns of the attractive centers, suggesting
that the pattern of inhomogeneity is unimportant. The phase diagrams also
include regions where superconductivity is obliterated due to the formation of
various charge ordered phases. The enhancement of T_{c} due to inhomogeneity is
robust as long as the electron doping per site n is less than twice the
fraction of interacting sites [2(1-f)] regardless of the pattern. We also show
that for certain inhomogeneous patterns, when n = 2(1-f), increasing
temperature can work against the stability of existing charge ordered phases
for large f and as a result, enhance T_{c}.

Modelling of AC loss in coils made of thin tapes under DC bias current,"  Many applications, such as magnets and SMES, are usually charged and
discharged under a bias DC current, which may increase the AC loss. For their
design, it is necessary to understand and predict the AC loss. This article
analises the AC loss in magnet-like coils under DC bias contribution
super-imposed to the AC current. The analysis is based on a numerical model
that takes the interaction between magnetization currents in all turns into
account. The studied example is a stack of 32 pancake coils with 200 turns each
made of thin tape, such as $Re$BCO coated conductor. We present the current
density, the instantaneous power loss, and loss per cycle. We have found that
the loss increases with the DC bias current. The instantaneous power loss is
the largest in the initial rise of the the AC current. In following cycles, the
power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease. The loss per
cycle is the largest at the end pancakes. In conclusion, the highest cooling
power should be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current
rise, specially the initial one. The presented model has a high potential to
predict the AC loss in magnet-size coils, useful for their design.

High-Spatial-Resolution K-Band Imaging of Select K2 Campaign Fields,"  NASA's K2 mission began observing fields along the ecliptic plane in 2014.
Each observing campaign lasts approximately 80 days, during which
high-precision optical photometry of select astrophysical targets is collected
by the Kepler spacecraft. Due to the 4 arcsec pixel scale of the Kepler
photometer, significant blending between the observed targets can occur
(especially in dense fields close to the Galactic plane). We undertook a
program to use the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the 3.8 m United Kingdom
InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) to collect high-spatial-resolution near-infrared
images of targets in select K2 campaign fields, which we report here. These 0.4
arcsec resolution K-band images offer the opportunity to perform a variety of
science, including vetting exoplanet candidates by identifying nearby stars
blended with the target star and estimating the size, color, and type of
galaxies observed by K2.

Non-local transport via edge-states in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells,"  We have investigated low-temperature electronic transport on InAs/GaSb double
quantum wells, a system which promises to be electrically tunable from a normal
to a topological insulator. Hall bars of $50\,\mu$m in length down to a few
$\mu$m gradually develop a pronounced resistance plateau near
charge-neutrality, which comes along with distinct non-local transport along
the edges. Plateau resistances are found to be above or below the quantized
value expected for helical edge channels. We discuss these results based on the
interplay between imperfect edges and residual local bulk conductivity.

tuning parameter choices in the machine learning part? (ii) How to assess
covariate balancing in high-dimensional settings? The results show that
improvements in objectively measured cognitive skills require at least medium

Business Rules in e-Government Applications,"  The introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into
public administrations has been radically changing the way organizations
cooperate and, more generally, the way to think about business processes over
organizational boundaries. In this paper we describe our approach to combining
business processes with business rules in order to integrate effectively single
units in an inter- or intra-organizational cooperation. Business rules
represent the knowledge that an administration has about its business; with
regard to this, they can express strategies, contracts and can influence not
only staff relations, but, finally, citizen relations, as well. In other words,
business rules are the core of an administration and affect either the business
processes or the behaviours of the system participants. They are typically
expressed implicitly in business contracts and they are embedded within the
source code of many application modules. So a concise and declarative statement
of business behaviour is converted into a set of programming instructions,
which are spread widely throughout the whole information system. In this way,
business rules are difficult to change and keep consistent over the time. For
this reason, it is necessary to reengineer the system in order to logically and
perhaps physically externalize rules from the application code. In our proposed
approach, we describe a cooperation as a collection of tasks combined in
certain ways according to the organization logic specified by business rules.
Our rule-driven methodology has the goal to make the business process design
more adaptable to the changes of internal or external environment.

Spin Precession Experiments for Light Axionic Dark Matter,"  Axion-like particles are promising candidates to make up the dark matter of
the universe, but it is challenging to design experiments that can detect them
over their entire allowed mass range. Dark matter in general, and in particular
axion-like particles and hidden photons, can be as light as roughly $10^{-22}
\;\rm{eV}$ ($\sim 10^{-8} \;\rm{Hz}$), with astrophysical anomalies providing
motivation for the lightest masses (""fuzzy dark matter""). We propose
experimental techniques for direct detection of axion-like dark matter in the
mass range from roughly $10^{-13} \;\rm{eV}$ ($\sim 10^2 \;\rm{Hz}$) down to
the lowest possible masses. In this range, these axion-like particles act as a
time-oscillating magnetic field coupling only to spin, inducing effects such as
a time-oscillating torque and periodic variations in the spin-precession
frequency with the frequency and direction set by fundamental physics. We show
how these signals can be measured using existing experimental technology,
including torsion pendulums, atomic magnetometers, and atom interferometry.
These experiments demonstrate a strong discovery capability, with future
iterations of these experiments capable of pushing several orders of magnitude
past current astrophysical bounds.

"Worst-case Throughput Analysis for Parametric Rate and Parametric Actor
  Execution Time Scenario-Aware Dataflow Graphs","  Scenario-aware dataflow (SADF) is a prominent tool for modeling and analysis
of dynamic embedded dataflow applications. In SADF the application is
represented as a finite collection of synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs, each
of which represents one possible application behaviour or scenario. A finite
state machine (FSM) specifies the possible orders of scenario occurrences. The
SADF model renders the tightest possible performance guarantees, but is limited
by its finiteness. This means that from a practical point of view, it can only
handle dynamic dataflow applications that are characterized by a reasonably
sized set of possible behaviours or scenarios. In this paper we remove this
limitation for a class of SADF graphs by means of SADF model parametrization in
terms of graph port rates and actor execution times. First, we formally define
the semantics of the model relevant for throughput analysis based on (max,+)
linear system theory and (max,+) automata. Second, by generalizing some of the
existing results, we give the algorithms for worst-case throughput analysis of
parametric rate and parametric actor execution time acyclic SADF graphs with a
fully connected, possibly infinite state transition system. Third, we

"Quantum frequency conversion to telecom of single photons from a
  nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond","  We report on the conversion to telecom wavelength of single photons emitted
by a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. By means of difference frequency
generation, we convert spin-selective photons at 637 nm, associated with the
coherent NV zero-phonon-line, to the target wavelength of 1588 nm in the
L-telecom band. The successful conversion is evidenced by time-resolved
detection revealing a telecom photon lifetime identical to that of the original
637 nm photon. Furthermore, we show by second-order correlation measurements
that the single-photon statistics are preserved. The overall efficiency of this
one-step conversion reaches 17\% in our current setup, along with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx$7 despite the low probability $(< 10^{-3})$
of an incident 637 nm photon. This result shows the potential for efficient
telecom photon - NV center interfaces and marks an important step towards
future long-range entanglement-based quantum networks.

"The Kepler Dichotomy in Planetary Disks: Linking Kepler Observables to
  Simulations of Late-Stage Planet Formation","  NASA's Kepler Mission uncovered a wealth of planetary systems, many with
planets on short-period orbits. These short-period systems reside around 50% of
Sun-like stars and are similarly prevalent around M dwarfs. Their formation and
subsequent evolution is the subject of active debate. In this paper, we
simulate late-stage, in-situ planet formation across a grid of planetesimal
disks with varying surface density profiles and total mass. We compare
simulation results with observable characteristics of the Kepler sample. We
identify mixture models with different primordial planetesimal disk properties
that self-consistently recover the multiplicity, period ratio and duration
ratio distributions of the Kepler planets. We draw three main conclusions: (1)
We favor a ""frozen-in"" narrative for systems of short period planets, in which
they are stable over long timescales, as opposed to metastable. (2) The ""Kepler
dichotomy"", an observed phenomenon of the Kepler sample wherein the
architectures of planetary systems appear to either vary significantly or have
multiple modes, can naturally be explained by formation within planetesimal
disks with varying surface density profiles. Finally, (3) we quantify the
nature of the ""Kepler dichotomy"" for both GK stars and M dwarfs, and find that
it varies with stellar type. While the mode of planet formation that accounts
for highly multiplistic systems occurs in 24+/-7% of planetary systems orbiting
GK stars, it occurs in 63+/-16% of planetary systems orbiting M dwarfs.

Model of a Programmable Quantum Processing Device,"  We propose a model of a programmable quantum processing device realizable
with existing nanophotonic technologies and which can be viewed as a basis for
new high performance hardware architectures. We present protocols and their
physical implementation on the controlled photon transfer for executing basic
single-qubit and multi-qubit gates. The possible operation of this quantum
computer scheme is analyzed. The physical architecture is then formalized by a
mathematical model of the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), which is used as a
basis for the Quantum Programming Framework that makes it possible to perform
universal quantum computations in a multitasking environment.

Supernovae as cosmological probes,"  The cosmological standard model at present is widely accepted as containing
mainly things we do not understand. In particular the appearance of a
Cosmological Constant, or dark energy, is puzzling. This was first inferred
from the Hubble diagram of a low number of Type Ia supernovae, and later
corroborated by complementary cosmological probes. Today, a much larger
collection of supernovae is available, and here I perform a rigorous
statistical analysis of this dataset. Taking into account how the supernovae
are calibrated to be standard candles, we run into some subtleties in the
analysis. To our surprise, this new dataset - about an order of bigger than the
size of the original dataset - shows, under standard assumptions, only mild
evidence of an accelerated universe.

that can be operator valued.

Exact Scalar-Tensor Cosmological Solutions via Noether Symmetry,"  In this paper, we investigate the Noether symmetries of a generalized
scalar-tensor, Brans-Dicke type cosmological model, in which we consider
explicit scalar field dependent couplings to the Ricci scalar, and to the
scalar field kinetic energy, respectively. We also include the scalar field
self-interaction potential into the gravitational action. From the condition of
the vanishing of the Lie derivative of the gravitational cosmological
Lagrangian with respect to a given vector field we obtain three cosmological
solutions describing the time evolution of a spatially flat
Friedman-Robertson-Walker Universe filled with a scalar field. The cosmological
properties of the solutions are investigated in detail, and it is shown that
they can describe a large variety of cosmological evolutions, including models
that experience a smooth transition from a decelerating to an accelerating
phase.

"Alternative schemes for measurement-device-independent quantum key
  distribution","  Practical schemes for measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
using phase and path or time encoding are presented. In addition to immunity to
existing loopholes in detection systems, our setup employs simple encoding and
decoding modules without relying on polarization maintenance or optical
switches. Moreover, by employing a modified sifting technique to handle the
dead-time limitations in single-photon detectors, our scheme can be run with
only two single-photon detectors. With a phase-postselection technique, a
decoy-state variant of our scheme is also proposed, whose key generation rate
scales linearly with the channel transmittance.

verified explicitly for any scheme and any given set of initial data by a
universal procedure. This procedure can be executed automatically and
rigorously by a computer when using interval arithmetics.

slightly destroyed rung-dimerization. Analytic expressions are obtained for the

At a strong diagonal frustration as well as at a rather strong

numerical calculations.

Cell-Free and User-Centric Massive MIMO at Millimeter Wave Frequencies,"  In a cell-free (CF) massive MIMO architecture a very large number of
distributed access points (APs) simultaneously and jointly serves a much
smaller number of mobile stations (MSs); a variant of the cell-free technique
is the user-centric (UC) approach, wherein each AP just decodes a reduced set
of MSs, practically the ones that are received best. This paper introduces and
analyzes the CF and UC architectures at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies.
First of all, a multiuser clustered channel model is introduced in order to
account for the correlation among the channels of nearby users; then, an uplink
multiuser channel estimation scheme is described along with low-complexity
hybrid analog/digital beamforming architectures. Interestingly, in the proposed
scheme no channel estimation is needed at the MSs, and the beamforming schemes
used at the MSs are channel-independent and have a very simple structure.
Numerical results show that the considered architectures provide good
performance, especially in lightly loaded systems, with the UC approach
outperforming the CF one.

Ergodic vs diffusive decoherence in mesoscopic devices,"  We report on the measurement of phase coherence length in a high mobility
two-dimensional electron gas patterned in two different geometries, a wire and
a ring. The phase coherence length is extracted both from the weak localization
correction in long wires and from the amplitude of the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations in a single ring, in a low temperature regime when decoherence is
dominated by electronic interactions. We show that these two measurements lead
to different phase coherence lengths, namely $L_{\Phi}^\mathrm{wire}\propto
T^{-1/3}$ and $L_{\Phi}^\mathrm{ring}\propto T^{-1/2}$. This difference
reflects the fact that the electrons winding around the ring necessarily
explore the whole sample (ergodic trajectories), while in a long wire the
electrons lose their phase coherence before reaching the edges of the sample
(diffusive regime).

GREAT: the SOFIA high-frequency heterodyne instrument,"  We describe the design and construction of GREAT, the German REceiver for
Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies operated on the Stratospheric Observatory
for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). GREAT is a modular dual-color heterodyne
instrument for highresolution far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy. Selected for
SOFIA's Early Science demonstration, the instrument has successfully performed
three Short and more than a dozen Basic Science flights since first light was
recorded on its April 1, 2011 commissioning flight.
  We report on the in-flight performance and operation of the receiver that -
in various flight configurations, with three different detector channels -
observed in several science-defined frequency windows between 1.25 and 2.5 THz.
The receiver optics was verified to be diffraction-limited as designed, with
nominal efficiencies; receiver sensitivities are state-of-the-art, with
excellent system stability. The modular design allows for the continuous
integration of latest technologies; we briefly discuss additional channels
under development and ongoing improvements for Cycle 1 observations.
  GREAT is a principal investigator instrument, developed by a consortium of
four German research institutes, available to the SOFIA users on a
collaborative basis.

that by exploiting certain symmetries, exact sampling and counting is in fact
possible in many nontrivial real-world cases. We illustrate with real datasets
including ecological co-occurrence matrices and contingency tables.

optimization is done at a single incident angle, the cloak provides reduced

Euclidean Partitions Optimizing Noise Stability,"  The Standard Simplex Conjecture of Isaksson and Mossel asks for the partition
$\{A_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into $k\leq n+1$ pieces of equal
Gaussian measure of optimal noise stability. That is, for $\rho>0$, we maximize
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}1_{A_{i}}(x)1_{A_{i}}(x\rho+y\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}})
e^{-(x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2})/2}e^{-(y_{1}^{2}+\cdots+y_{n}^{2})/2}dxdy. $$
Isaksson and Mossel guessed the best partition for this problem and proved some
applications of their conjecture. For example, the Standard Simplex Conjecture
implies the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture. For $k=3,n\geq2$ and
$0<\rho<\rho_{0}(k,n)$, we prove the Standard Simplex Conjecture. The full
conjecture has applications to theoretical computer science, and to geometric
multi-bubble problems (after Isaksson and Mossel).

Cosmological intersecting brane solutions,"  The recent discovery of an explicit dynamical description of p-branes makes
it possible to investigate the existence of intersection of such objects. We
generalize the solutions depending on the overall transverse space coordinates
and time to those which depend also on the relative transverse space and
satisfy new intersection rules. We give classification of these dynamical
intersecting brane solutions involving two branes, and discuss the application
of these solutions to cosmology and show that these give
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological solutions. Finally, we
construct the brane world models, using the (cut-)copy-paste method after
compactifying the trivial spatial dimensions. We then find that interesting
brane world models can be obtained from codimension-one branes and several
static branes with higher codimensions. We also classify the behaviors of the
brane world near the future/past singularity.

"Collective behavior of quorum-sensing run-and-tumble particles in
  confinement","  We study a generic model for quorum-sensing bacteria in circular confinement.
Every bacterium produces signaling molecules, the local concentration of which
triggers a response when a certain threshold is reached. If this response
lowers the motility then an aggregation of bacteria occurs, which differs
fundamentally from standard motility-induced phase separation due to the
long-ranged nature of the concentration of signal molecules. We analyze this
phenomenon analytically and by numerical simulations employing two different
protocols leading to stationary cluster and ring morphologies, respectively.

The Relation Between Classical and Quantum Mechanics,"  Familiar formulations of classical and quantum mechanics are shown to follow
from a general theory of mechanics based on pure states with an intrinsic
probability structure. This theory is developed to the stage where theorems
from quantum logic enable expression of the state geometry in Hilbert space.
Quantum and classical mechanics are then elaborated and applied to subsystems
and the measurement process. Consideration is also given to space-time geometry
and the constraints this places on the dynamics. Physics and Mathematics, it is
argued, are growing apart; the inadequate treatment of approximations in
general and localisation in quantum mechanics in particular are seen as
contributing factors. In the description of systems, the link between
localisation and lack of knowledge shows that quantum mechanics should reflect
the domain of applicability. Restricting the class of states provides a means
of achieving this goal. Localisation is then shown to have a mathematical
expression in terms of compactness, which in turn is applied to yield a
topological theory of bound and scattering states. Finally, the thesis
questions the validity of classical limits and quantisations in intertheoretic
reduction, and demonstrates that a widely accepted classical limit does not
constitute a proof of reduction. It proposes a procedure for determining
whether classical and quantum mechanics are weakly equivalent over a domain of
applicability, and concludes that, in this restricted sense, classical
mechanics reduces to quantum mechanics.

Self Adversarial Training for Human Pose Estimation,"  This paper presents a deep learning based approach to the problem of human
pose estimation. We employ generative adversarial networks as our learning
paradigm in which we set up two stacked hourglass networks with the same
architecture, one as the generator and the other as the discriminator. The
generator is used as a human pose estimator after the training is done. The
discriminator distinguishes ground-truth heatmaps from generated ones, and
back-propagates the adversarial loss to the generator. This process enables the
generator to learn plausible human body configurations and is shown to be
useful for improving the prediction accuracy.

"Household poverty classification in data-scarce environments: a machine
  learning approach","  We describe a method to identify poor households in data-scarce countries by
leveraging information contained in nationally representative household
surveys. It employs standard statistical learning techniques---cross-validation
and parameter regularization---which together reduce the extent to which the
model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey data. The
automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development
setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the
costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed
to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after
data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the
model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that
may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data
from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households
from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.

"Broadcast Approach and Oblivious Cooperative Strategies for the Wireless
  Relay Channel - Part I: Sequential Decode-and-Forward (SDF)","  In this two part paper we consider a wireless network in which a source
terminal communicates with a destination and a relay terminal is occasionally
present in close proximity to the source without source's knowledge, suggesting
oblivious protocols. The source-relay channel is assumed to be a fixed gain
AWGN due to the proximity while the source-destination and the
relay-destination channels are subject to a block flat Rayleigh fading. A
perfect CSI at the respective receivers only is assumed. With the average
throughput as a performance measure, we incorporate a two-layer broadcast
approach into two cooperative strategies based on the decode-and-forward scheme
- Sequential Decoded-and Forward (SDF) in part I and the Block-Markov (BM) in
part II. The broadcast approach splits the transmitted rate into superimposed
layers corresponding to a ""bad"" and a ""good"" channel states, allowing better
adaptation to the actual channel conditions In part I, the achievable rate
expressions for the SDF strategy are derived under the broadcast approach for
multiple settings including single user, MISO and the general relay setting
using successive decoding technique, both numerically and analytically.
Continuous broadcasting lower bounds are derived for the MISO and an oblivious
cooperation scenarios.

"The Effect of Jupiter's Formation on the Distribution of Refractory
  Elements and Inclusions in Meteorites","  We present a comprehensive evolutionary model of the Sun's protoplanetary
disk, constructed to resolve the ""CAI Storage"" problem of meteoritics. We
predict the abundances of calcium-rich, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and
refractory lithophile elements under the central assumption that Jupiter's
$\sim 30 \, M_{\oplus}$ core forms at about 3 AU at around 0.6 Myr and opened a
gap CAIs are trapped in the pressure maximum beyond Jupiter; carbonaceous
chondrites formed there. Inside Jupiter's orbit, CAIs were depleted by
aerodynamic drag; ordinary and enstatite chondrites formed there. For 16
chondrites and achondrites, we review meteoritic data on their CAI and
refractory abundances and their times of formation, constrained by radiometric
dating and thermal models. We predict their formation locations, finding
excellent consistency with other location information (water content, asteroid
spectra and parent bodies). We predict the size of particle concentrated by
turbulence for each chondrite, finding excellent matches to each chondrites's
mean chondrule diameter. These consistencies imply meteorite parent bodies
assembled quickly from local materials concentrated by turbulence, and usually
did not migrate far. We predict CI chondrites are depleted in refractory
lithophile elements relative to the Sun, by about 12% (0.06 dex). We constrain
the variation of turbulence parameter $\alpha$ in the disk, and find a limited
role for magnetorotational instability, favoring hydrodynamical instabilities
in the outer disk, plus magnetic disk winds in the inner disk. Between 3 and 4
Myr at least, gas persisted outside Jupiter but was depleted inside it, and the
solar nebula was a transition disk.

Arithmetic of 0-cycles on varieties defined over number fields,"  Let $X$ be a rationally connected algebraic variety, defined over a number
field $k$. We find a relation between the arithmetic of rational points on $X$
and the arithmetic of zero-cycles. More precisely, we consider the following
statements: (1) the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to weak
approximation for $K$-rational points on $X_K$ for all finite extensions $K/k$;
(2) the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to weak approximation
in some sense that we define for zero-cycles of degree 1 on $X_K$ for all
finite extensions $K/k$; (3) a certain sequence of local-global type for Chow
groups of 0-cycles on $X_K$ is exact for all finite extensions $K/k$. We prove
that (1) implies (2), and that (2) and (3) are equivalent. We also prove a
similar implication for the Hasse principle.
  As an application, we prove the exactness of the sequence mentioned above for
smooth compactifications of certain homogeneous spaces of linear algebraic
groups.

Homologous Control of Protein Signaling Networks,"  In a previous paper we introduced a method called augmented sparse
reconstruction (ASR) that identifies links among nodes of ordinary differential
equation networks, given a small set of observed trajectories with various
initial conditions. The main purpose of that technique was to reconstruct
intracellular protein signaling networks. In this paper we show that a
recursive augmented sparse reconstruction generates artificial networks that
are homologous to a large, reference network, in the sense that kinase
inhibition of several reactions in the network alters the trajectories of a
sizable number of proteins in comparable ways for reference and reconstructed
networks. We show this result using a large in-silico model of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGF-R) driven signaling cascade to generate the data
used in the reconstruction algorithm. The most significant consequence of this
observed homology is that a nearly optimal combinatorial dosage of kinase
inhibitors can be inferred, for many nodes, from the reconstructed network, a
result potentially useful for a variety of applications in personalized
medicine.

Searching for luminous absorbed sources in the WISE AGN catalogue,"  Mid-IR colour selection techniques have proved to be very efficient in
finding AGN. This is because the AGN heats the surrounding dust producing warm
mid-IR colours. Using the WISE 3.6, 4.5 and 12 $\mu m$ colours, the largest
sample of IR selected AGN has already been produced containing 1.4 million AGN
over the whole sky. Here, we explore the X-ray properties of this AGN sample by
cross-correlating it with the subsample of the 3XMM X-ray catalogue that has
available X-ray spectra and at the same time optical spectroscopy from SDSS.
Our goal is to find rare luminous obscured AGN. Our final sample contains 65
QSOs with $\rm{log}\,\nu L_\nu \ge 46.2$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. This IR luminosity cut
corresponds to $\rm{log}\,L_X \approx 45$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, at the median
redshift of our sample ($z=2.3$), that lies at the bright end of the X-ray
luminosity function at $z>2$. The X-ray spectroscopic analysis reveals seven
obscured AGN having a column density $\rm N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}$. Six of them
show evidence for broad [CIV] absorption lines and five are classified as
BALQSOs. We fit the optical spectra of our X-ray absorbed sources to estimate
the optical reddening. We find that none of these show any obscuration
according to the optical continuum. These sources add to the growing evidence
for populations of luminous QSOs with evidence for substantial absorption by
outflowing ionised material, similar to those expected to be emerging from
their absorbing cocoons in the framework of AGN/galaxy co-evolution.

"The free Dirac spinors of the spin basis on the de Sitter expanding
  universe","  It is shown that on the de Sitter space-time the global behavior of the free
Dirac spinors in momentum representation is determined by several phases
factors which are functions of momentum with special properties. Such suitable
phase functions can be chosen for writing down the free Dirac quantum modes of
the spin basis that are well-defined even for the particles at rest in the
moving local charts where the modes of the helicity basis remain undefined.
Under quantization these modes lead to a basis in which the one-particle
operators keep their usual forms apart from the energy operator which lays out
a specific term which depend on the concrete phase function one uses.

"Hybrid CPU-GPU generation of the Hamiltonian and Overlap matrices in
  FLAPW methods","  In this paper we focus on the integration of high-performance numerical
libraries in ab initio codes and the portability of performance and
scalability. The target of our work is FLEUR, a software for electronic
structure calculations developed in the Forschungszentrum J\""ulich over the
course of two decades. The presented work follows up on a previous effort to
modernize legacy code by re-engineering and rewriting it in terms of highly
optimized libraries. We illustrate how this initial effort to get efficient and
portable shared-memory code enables fast porting of the code to emerging
heterogeneous architectures. More specifically, we port the code to nodes
equipped with multiple GPUs. We divide our study in two parts. First, we show
considerable speedups attained by minor and relatively straightforward code
changes to off-load parts of the computation to the GPUs. Then, we identify
further possible improvements to achieve even higher performance and
scalability. On a system consisting of 16-cores and 2 GPUs, we observe speedups
of up to 5x with respect to our optimized shared-memory code, which in turn
means between 7.5x and 12.5x speedup with respect to the original FLEUR code.

prove pointwise error estimates for classical solutions with H\""older and
Sobolev regularity. We also derive convergence rates for viscosity solutions

"On the binary nature of massive blue hypergiants: high-resolution X-ray
  spectroscopy suggests that Cyg OB2 12 is a colliding wind binary","  The blue hypergiant Cyg OB2-12 (B3Ia+) is a representative member of the
class of very massive stars in a poorly understood evolutionary stage. We
obtained its high-resolution X-ray spectrum using Chandra observatory. PoWR
model atmospheres were calculated to provide realistic wind opacities and to
establish the wind density structure. We find that collisional de-excitation is
the dominant mechanism de-populating the metastable upper levels of the
forbidden lines of the He-like ions SiXIV and MgXII. Comparison between the
model and observations reveals that X-ray emission is produced in a dense
plasma, which could reside only at the photosphere or in a colliding wind zone
between binary components. The observed X-ray spectra are well fitted by
thermal plasma models, with average temperatures in excess of 10 MK. The wind
speed in Cyg OB2-12 is not high enough to power such high temperatures, but the
collision of two winds in a binary system can be sufficient. We used archival
data to investigate the X-ray properties of other blue hypergiants. In general,
stars of this class are not detected as X-rays sources. We suggest that our new
Chandra observations of Cyg OB2-12 can be best explained if Cyg OB2-12 is a
colliding wind binary possessing a late O-type companion. This makes Cyg OB2-12
only the second binary system among the 16 known Galactic hypergiants. This low
binary fraction indicates that the blue hypergiants are likely products of
massive binary evolution during which they either accreted a significant amount
of mass or already merged with their companion.

"A novel technique for image steganography based on Block-DCT and Huffman
  Encoding","  Image steganography is the art of hiding information into a cover image. This
paper presents a novel technique for Image steganography based on Block-DCT,
where DCT is used to transform original image (cover image) blocks from spatial
domain to frequency domain. Firstly a gray level image of size M x N is divided
into no joint 8 x 8 blocks and a two dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2-d
DCT) is performed on each of the P = MN / 64 blocks. Then Huffman encoding is
also performed on the secret messages/images before embedding and each bit of
Huffman code of secret message/image is embedded in the frequency domain by
altering the least significant bit of each of the DCT coefficients of cover
image blocks. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high
capacity and a good invisibility. Moreover PSNR of cover image with stego-image
shows the better results in comparison with other existing steganography
approaches. Furthermore, satisfactory security is maintained since the secret
message/image cannot be extracted without knowing decoding rules and Huffman
table.

"Measurements and analysis of current-voltage characteristic of a pn
  diode for an undergraduate physics laboratory","  We show that in a simple experiment at undergraduate level, suitable to be
performed in classes of science and engineering students, it is possible to
test accurately, on a popular 1N4148 p-n diode, the range of the junction
currents where the Shockley equation model can be considered satisfactory. The
experiment benefits from a system of temperature control and data collection
driven in a LabVIEW environment. With these tools a large quantity of data can
be recorded in the temporal frame of a lab session. Significant deviations of
the experimental I-V with respect to the ideal behaviour curve predicted by the
Shockley equation are observed, both at low and high current. A better
agreement over the entire range is obtained introducing, as is customary, a
four parameters model, including a parallel and a series resistance. A new
iterative fitting procedure is presented which treats the I-V data of different
regimes on the same level, and allows a simultaneous determination of the four
parameters for each temperature selected. Moreover, the knowledge of the
temperature dependence of saturation current is used to estimate the energy gap
of silicon. The connection of a macroscopic measure with a microscopic quantity
is another valuable feature of this experiment, from an educational point of
view.

"Thermally activated switching of perpendicular magnet by spin-orbit spin
  torque","  We theoretically investigate the threshold current for thermally activated
switching of a perpendicular magnet by spin-orbit spin torque. Based on the
Fokker-Planck equation, we obtain an analytic expression of the switching
current, in agreement with numerical result. We find that thermal energy
barrier exhibits a quasi-linear dependence on the current, resulting in an
almost linear dependence of switching current on the log-scaled current
pulse-width even below 10 ns. This is in stark contrast to standard spin torque
switching, where thermal energy barrier has a quadratic dependence on the
current and the switching current rapidly increases at short pulses. Our
results will serve as a guideline to design and interpret switching experiments
based on spin-orbit spin torque

millions or billions of features (dimensions) per sample, with the hope that
data science techniques will be able to build accurate data-driven inferences.
Because sample sizes are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the
dimensionality of these data, valid inferences require finding a
low-dimensional representation that preserves the discriminating information
(e.g., whether the individual suffers from a particular disease). There is a
lack of interpretable supervised dimensionality reduction methods that scale to
millions of dimensions with strong statistical theoretical guarantees.We
introduce an approach, XOX, to extending principal components analysis by
incorporating class-conditional moment estimates into the low-dimensional
projection. The simplest ver-sion, ""Linear Optimal Low-rank"" projection (LOL),
incorporates the class-conditional means. We prove, and substantiate with both
synthetic and real data benchmarks, that LOL and its generalizations in the XOX
framework lead to improved data representations for subsequent classification,
while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. Using multiple
brain imaging datasets consisting of >150 million features, and several
genomics datasets with>500,000 features, LOL outperforms other scalable linear
dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of accuracy, while only requiring
a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.

Determining Optimal Trading Rules without Backtesting,"  Calibrating a trading rule using a historical simulation (also called
backtest) contributes to backtest overfitting, which in turn leads to
underperformance. In this paper we propose a procedure for determining the
optimal trading rule (OTR) without running alternative model configurations
through a backtest engine. We present empirical evidence of the existence of
such optimal solutions for the case of prices following a discrete
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show how they can be computed numerically.
Although we do not derive a closed-form solution for the calculation of OTRs,
we conjecture its existence on the basis of the empirical evidence presented.

"Pump-Enhanced Continuous-Wave Magnetometry using Nitrogen-Vacancy
  Ensembles","  Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are a highly promising
platform for high-sensitivity magnetometry, whose efficacy is often based on
efficiently generating and monitoring magnetic-field dependent infrared
fluorescence. Here we report on an increased sensing efficiency with the use of
a 532-nm resonant confocal cavity and a microwave resonator antenna for
measuring the local magnetic noise density using the intrinsic nitrogen-vacancy
concentration of a chemical-vapor deposited single-crystal diamond. We measure
a near-shot-noise-limited magnetic noise floor of 200 pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$
spanning a bandwidth up to 159 Hz, and an extracted sensitivity of
approximately 3 nT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with further enhancement limited by the
noise floor of the lock-in amplifier and the laser damage threshold of the
optical components. Exploration of the microwave and optical pump-rate
parameter space demonstrates a linewidth-narrowing regime reached by virtue of
using the optical cavity, allowing an enhanced sensitivity to be achieved,
despite an unoptimized collection efficiency of <2 %, and a low
nitrogen-vacancy concentration of about 0.2 ppb.

Oceanic rings and jets as statistical equilibrium states,"  Equilibrium statistical mechanics of two-dimensional flows provides an
explanation and a prediction for the self-organization of large scale coherent
structures. This theory is applied in this paper to the description of oceanic
rings and jets, in the framework of a 1.5 layer quasi-geostrophic model. The
theory predicts the spontaneous formation of regions where the potential
vorticity is homogenized, with strong and localized jets at their interface.
Mesoscale rings are shown to be close to a statistical equilibrium: the theory
accounts for their shape, their drift, and their ubiquity in the ocean,
independently of the underlying generation mechanism. At basin scale, inertial
states presenting mid basin eastward jets (and then different from the
classical Fofonoff solution) are described as marginally unstable states. These
states are shown to be marginally unstable for the equilibrium statistical
theory. In that case, considering a purely inertial limit is a first step
toward more comprehensive out of equilibrium studies that would take into
account other essential aspects, such as wind forcing.

3D view of transient horizontal magnetic fields in the photosphere,"  We infer the 3D magnetic structure of a transient horizontal magnetic field
(THMF) during its evolution through the photosphere using SIRGAUS inversion
code. The SIRGAUS code is a modified version of SIR (Stokes Inversion based on
Response function), and allows for retrieval of information on the magnetic and
thermodynamic parameters of the flux tube embedded in the atmosphere from the
observed Stokes profiles. Spectro-polarimetric observations of the quiet Sun at
the disk center were performed with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board
Hinode with Fe I 630.2 nm lines. Using repetitive scans with a cadence of 130
s, we first detect the horizontal field that appears inside a granule, near its
edge. On the second scan, vertical fields with positive and negative polarities
appear at both ends of the horizontal field. Then, the horizontal field
disappears leaving the bipolar vertical magnetic fields. The results from the
inversion of the Stokes spectra clearly point to the existence of a flux tube
with magnetic field strength of $\sim400$ G rising through the line forming
layer of the Fe I 630.2 nm lines. The flux tube is located at around
$\log\tau_{500} \sim0$ at $\Delta t$=0 s and around $\log\tau_{500} \sim-1.7$
at $\Delta t$=130 s. At $\Delta t$=260 s the horizontal part is already above
the line forming region of the analyzed lines. The observed Doppler velocity is
maximally 3 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the upward motion of the structure as
retrieved from the SIRGAUS code. The vertical size of the tube is smaller than
the thickness of the line forming layer. The THMF has a clear
$\Omega$-shaped-loop structure with the apex located near the edge of a
granular cell. The magnetic flux carried by this THMF is estimated to be
$3.1\times10^{17}$ Mx.

"Qualitative Insight and Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of
  Temperature on the Coercivity of a Magnetic System","  The temperature dependence of the response of a magnetic system to an applied
field can be understood qualitatively by considering variations in the energy
surface characterizing the system and estimated quantitatively with rate
theory. In the system analysed here, Fe/Sm-Co spring magnet, the width of the
hysteresis loop is reduced to a half when temperature is raised from 25~K to
300~K. This narrowing can be explained and reproduced quantitatively without
invoking temperature dependence of model parameters as has typically been done
in previous data analysis. The applied magnetic field lowers the energy barrier
for reorientation of the magnetization but thermal activation brings the system
over the barrier. A 2-dimensional representation of the energy surface is
developed and used to gain insight into the transition mechanism and to
demonstrate how the applied field alters the transition path. Our results show
the importance of explicitly including the effect of thermal activation when
interpreting experiments involving the manipulation of magnetic systems at
finite temperature.

WIDGET: System Performance and GRB Prompt Optical Observations,"  The WIDeField telescope for Gamma-ray burst Early Timing (WIDGET) is used for
a fully automated, ultra-wide-field survey aimed at detecting the prompt
optical emission associated with Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). WIDGET surveys the
HETE-2 and Swift/BAT pointing directions covering a total field of view of 62
degree x 62 degree every 10 secounds using an unfiltered system. This
monitoring survey allows exploration of the optical emission before the
gamma-ray trigger. The unfiltered magnitude is well converted to the SDSS r'
system at a 0.1 mag level. Since 2004, WIDGET has made a total of ten
simultaneous and one pre-trigger GRB observations. The efficiency of
synchronized observation with HETE-2 is four times better than that of Swift.
There has been no bright optical emission similar to that from GRB 080319B. The
statistical analysis implies that GRB080319B is a rare event. This paper
summarizes the design and operation of the WIDGET system and the simultaneous
GRB observations obtained with this instrument.

New ways to search for right-handed current in B -> rho ell nu decay,"  An interesting possibility to ease the tension between various determinations
of |V_{ub}| is to allow a small right-handed contribution to the standard model
weak current. The present bounds on such a contribution are fairly weak. We
propose new ways to search for such a beyond standard model contribution in
semileptonic B -> rho ell nu decay. Generalized asymmetries in one, two, or
three angular variables are introduced as discriminators, which do not require
an unbinned analysis of the fully differential distribution, and a detailed
study of the corresponding theoretical uncertainties is performed. A discussion
on how binned measurements can access all the angular information follows,
which may be useful in both B -> rho ell nu and B -> K^* ell^+ ell^-, and
possibly essential in the former decay due to backgrounds. The achievable
sensitivity from the available BaBar and Belle data sets is explored, as well
as from the anticipated 50 ab^{-1} Belle II data.

A Local Quantum Phase Transition in YFe$_{2}$Al$_{10}$,"  A phase transition occurs when correlated regions of a new phase grow to span
the system and the fluctuations within the correlated regions become
long-lived. Here we present neutron scattering measurements showing that this
conventional picture must be replaced by a new paradigm in
\boldmath$\mathrm{YFe}_2\mathrm{Al}_{10}$, a compound that forms naturally very
close to a \boldmath$T=0$ quantum phase transition. Fully quantum mechanical
fluctuations of localized moments are found to diverge at low energies and
temperatures, however the fluctuating moments are entirely without spatial
correlations. Zero temperature order in
\boldmath$\mathrm{YFe}_2\mathrm{Al}_{10}$ is achieved by a new and entirely
local type of quantum phase transition that may originate with the creation of
the moments themselves.

"Density dependence of the Ionization Avalanche in ultracold Rydberg
  gases","  We report on the behaviour of the ionization avalanche in an ensemble of
ultracold 87Rb atoms coupled to a high lying Rydberg state and investigate
extensions to the current model by including the effects of three-body
recombination and plasma expansion. To separate the two effects we study the
time dependence of the plasma formation at various densities as well as for
different nS and nD states. At medium densities and low n we observe the onset
of the avalanche as has been reported in other experiments, as well as a
subsequent turn-off of the avalanche for longer excitation times, which we
associate with plasma expansion. At higher densities and for higher lying
Rydberg states we observe a disappearance of the avalanche signature, which we
attribute to three-body recombination.

Worst-Case Load Shedding in Electric Power Networks,"  We consider the worst-case load-shedding problem in electric power networks
where a number of transmission lines are to be taken out of service. The
objective is to identify a pre-specified number of line outage that leads to
the maximum interruption of power generation and load at the transmission
level, subject to the AC power flow model, the load and generation capacity of
the buses, and the phase angle limit across the transmission lines. For this
nonlinear model with binary constraints, we show that all decision variables
are separable except for the nonlinear power flow equations. We develop an
iterative decomposition algorithm, which converts the worst-case load shedding
problem into a sequence of small subproblems. We show that the subproblems are
either convex problems that can be solved efficiently or nonconvex problems
that have closed-form solutions. Consequently, our approach is scalable for
large networks. Furthermore, we prove global convergence of our algorithm to a
critical point and the objective value is guaranteed to decrease throughout the
iterations. Numerical experiments with IEEE test cases demonstrate the
effectiveness of the developed approach.

of two ferromagnetic Ising models with zero-temperature ordering. By
introducing a scaling variable motivated by high-temperature series expansions,
we are able to scale data for the one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet rigorously
over the entire temperature range. Analogous scaling expressions are then
applied to the two-dimensional fully frustrated Villain model where excellent
finite-size scaling over the entire temperature range is achieved. Thus we
broaden the applicability of the extended scaling method to Ising systems
having a zero-temperature critical point.

non-invasive, does not require any knowledge about the underlying dynamics, and
is applicable even when only partial information is available. We apply it to
simple stochastic models of chemical reactions involving a finite number of
states, and for this case, we study how the estimate of dissipation is affected
by the degree of coarse-graining present in the input data.

Algebraic Geometry deal with manifestly infinite-dimensional algebraic

drawn from applications in algebraic statistics and multilinear algebra. My
hope is that these notes will attract other mathematicians to this vibrant area
at the crossroads of combinatorics, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry,
statistics, and other applications.

Wedge operations and torus symmetries II,"  A fundamental idea in toric topology is that classes of manifolds with
well-behaved torus actions (simply, toric spaces) are classified by pairs of
simplicial complexes and (non-singular) characteristic maps. The authors in
their previous paper provided a new way to find all characteristic maps on a
simplicial complex $K(J)$ obtainable by a sequence of wedgings from $K$. The
main idea was that characteristic maps on $K$ theoretically determine all
possible characteristic maps on a wedge of $K$.
  In this work, we further develop our previous work for classification of
toric spaces. For a star-shaped simplicial sphere $K$ of dimension $n-1$ with
$m$ vertices, the Picard number $\operatorname{Pic}(K)$ of $K$ is $m-n$. We
refer to $K$ a seed if $K$ cannot be obtained by wedgings. First, we show that,
for a fixed positive integer $\ell$, there are at most finitely many seeds of
Picard number $\ell$ supporting characteristic maps. As a corollary, the
conjecture proposed by V. V. Batyrev in 1991 is solved affirmatively.
  Second, we investigate a systematic way to find all characteristic maps on
$K(J)$ using combinatorial objects called (realizable) puzzles that only depend
on a seed $K$. These two facts lead to a practical way to classify the toric
spaces of fixed Picard number.

equivalent to a new transport-chi-square inequality linking the square of the

AdS Black Hole Solutions in the Extended New Massive Gravity,"  We have obtained (warped) AdS black hole solutions in the three dimensional
extended new massive gravity. We investigate some properties of black holes and
obtain central charges of the two dimensional dual CFT. To obtain the central
charges, we use the relation between entropy and temperature according to the
AdS/CFT dictionary. For AdS black holes, one can also use the central charge
function formalism which leads to the same results.

Can one extract energy loss probability distributions from R_AA?,"  The nuclear suppression of high transverse momentum P_T hadrons is one of the
most striking findings in heavy-ion collision experiments. It has long been
recognized that the suppression can be theoretically described by folding the
primary parton spectrum with an energy loss probability distribution which is
suitably averaged over the collision geometry. However, an interesting problem
is to what degree the procedure can be inverted, i.e. given a measurement of
the suppression factor R_AA with arbitrary precision, can the probability
distribution of energy loss be extracted in a model-independent way? In this
note, we present a conceptual study of the inversion problem for LHC energies
and demonstrate that a measurement of R_AA alone is insufficient to determine
the distribution, other observables such as gamma-hadron correlations must be
taken into account.

"Gaps in the HD169142 protoplanetary disk revealed by polarimetric
  imaging: Signs of ongoing planet formation?","  We present H-band VLT/NACO polarized light images of the Herbig Ae/Be star
HD169142 probing its protoplanetary disk as close as ~0.1"" to the star. Our
images trace the face-on disk out to ~1.7"" (~250 AU) and reveal distinct
sub-structures for the first time: 1) the inner disk (<20 AU) appears to be
depleted in scattering dust grains; 2) an unresolved disk rim is imaged at ~25
AU; 3) an annular gap extends from ~40 - 70 AU; 4) local brightness asymmetries
are found on opposite sides of the annular gap. We discuss different
explanations for the observed morphology among which ongoing planet formation
is a tempting - but yet to be proven - one. Outside of ~85 AU the surface
brightness drops off roughly r^{-3.3}, but describing the disk regions between
85-120 AU / 120-250 AU separately with power-laws r^{-2.6} / r^{-3.9} provides
a better fit hinting towards another discontinuity in the disk surface. The
flux ratio between the disk integrated polarized light and the central star is
~4.1 * 10^{-3}. Finally, combining our results with those from the literature,
~40% of the scattered light in the H-band appears to be polarized. Our results
emphasize that HD169142 is an interesting system for future planet formation or
disk evolution studies.

Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy by stepwise optical saturation,"  Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is an important tool in biomedical
research for its ability to discern features smaller than the diffraction
limit. However, due to its difficult implementation and high cost, the
universal application of super-resolution microscopy is not feasible. In this
paper, we propose and demonstrate a new kind of super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy that can be easily implemented and requires neither additional
hardware nor complex post-processing. The microscopy is based on the principle
of stepwise optical saturation (SOS), where $M$ steps of raw fluorescence
images are linearly combined to generate an image with a $\sqrt{M}$-fold
increase in resolution compared with conventional diffraction-limited images.
For example, linearly combining (scaling and subtracting) two images obtained
at regular powers extends resolution by a factor of $1.4$ beyond the
diffraction limit. The resolution improvement in SOS microscopy is
theoretically infinite but practically is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio.
We perform simulations and experimentally demonstrate super-resolution
microscopy with both one-photon (confocal) and multiphoton excitation
fluorescence. We show that with the multiphoton modality, the SOS microscopy
can provide super-resolution imaging deep in scattering samples.

"Evolution of the Stellar Mass--Metallicity Relation - I: Galaxies in the
  z~0.4 Cluster Cl0024","  We present the stellar mass-stellar metallicity relationship (MZR) in the
Cl0024+1654 galaxy cluster at z~0.4 using full spectrum stellar population
synthesis modeling of individual quiescent galaxies. The lower limit of our
stellar mass range is $M_*=10^{9.7}M_\odot$, the lowest galaxy mass at which
individual stellar metallicity has been measured beyond the local universe. We
report a detection of an evolution of the stellar MZR with observed redshift at
$0.037\pm0.007$ dex per Gyr, consistent with the predictions from
hydrodynamical simulations. Additionally, we find that the evolution of the
stellar MZR with observed redshift can be explained by an evolution of the
stellar MZR with their formation time, i.e., when the single stellar population
(SSP)-equivalent ages of galaxies are taken into account. This behavior is
consistent with stars forming out of gas that also has an MZR with a
normalization that decreases with redshift. Lastly, we find that over the
observed mass range, the MZR can be described by a linear function with a
shallow slope, ($[Fe/H] \propto (0.16 \pm 0.03) \log M_*$). The slope suggests
that galaxy feedback, in terms of mass-loading factor, might be
mass-independent over the observed mass and redshift range.

"Adaptive and Iterative Multi-Branch MMSE Decision Feedback Detection
  Algorithms for MIMO Systems","  In this work, decision feedback (DF) detection algorithms based on multiple
processing branches for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing
systems are proposed. The proposed detector employs multiple cancellation
branches with receive filters that are obtained from a common matrix inverse
and achieves a performance close to the maximum likelihood detector (MLD).
Constrained minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receive filters designed with
constraints on the shape and magnitude of the feedback filters for the
multi-branch MMSE DF (MB-MMSE-DF) receivers are presented. An adaptive
implementation of the proposed MB-MMSE-DF detector is developed along with a
recursive least squares-type algorithm for estimating the parameters of the
receive filters when the channel is time-varying. A soft-output version of the
MB-MMSE-DF detector is also proposed as a component of an iterative detection
and decoding receiver structure. A computational complexity analysis shows that
the MB-MMSE-DF detector does not require a significant additional complexity
over the conventional MMSE-DF detector, whereas a diversity analysis discusses
the diversity order achieved by the MB-MMSE-DF detector. Simulation results
show that the MB-MMSE-DF detector achieves a performance superior to existing
suboptimal detectors and close to the MLD, while requiring significantly lower
complexity.

Rabi-coupled Countersuperflow in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates,"  We show theoretically that periodic density patterns are stabilized in two
counter-propagating Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms in different hyperfine
states under Rabi coupling. In the presence of coupling, the relative velocity
between two components is localized around density depressions in
quasi-one-dimensional systems. When the relative velocity is sufficiently
small, the periodic pattern reduces to a periodic array of topological solitons
as kinks of relative phase. According to our variational and numerical
analyses, the soliton solution is well characterized by the soliton width and
density depression. We demonstrate the dependence of the depression and width
on the Rabi frequency and the coupling constant of inter-component
density-density interactions. The periodic pattern of the relative phase
transforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the
period becomes smaller than the soliton width. These patterns become unstable
when the localized relative velocity exceeds a critical value. The
stability-phase diagram of this system is evaluated with a stability analysis
of countersuperflow, by taking into account the finite-size-effect owing to the
density depression.

"The I/O complexity of Strassen's matrix multiplication with
  recomputation","  A tight $\Omega((n/\sqrt{M})^{\log_2 7}M)$ lower bound is derived on the \io
complexity of Strassen's algorithm to multiply two $n \times n$ matrices, in a
two-level storage hierarchy with $M$ words of fast memory. A proof technique is
introduced, which exploits the Grigoriev's flow of the matrix multiplication
function as well as some combinatorial properties of the Strassen computational
directed acyclic graph (CDAG). Applications to parallel computation are also
developed. The result generalizes a similar bound previously obtained under the
constraint of no-recomputation, that is, that intermediate results cannot be
computed more than once. For this restricted case, another lower bound
technique is presented, which leads to a simpler analysis of the \io complexity
of Strassen's algorithm and can be readily extended to other ""Strassen-like""
algorithms.
